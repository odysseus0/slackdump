Otherwise, it's just a tit for tat game with other builders where they are super adversarial against each other and are trying to disrupt eachother. Or, all the value gets bid to 0 and even below as people subsidize orderflow.\n",

      "• They were not expecting their success and have no roadmap or analytics. They would be happy to give log data to FB data team for analytical help.\n",
      "• Currently evaluating whether they 1) continue this project and add features or 2) they find an exit with the least brain damage as possible (Tina is brokering a deal).\n",
      "• Worried about regulatory and will release a non-custodial feature in the next few weeks that should eliminate most legal liability.\n",
      "• They have a separate Discord of power users and share pnl dashboards and new features with them first.\n",
      "• They have never raised money.\n",
      "• James views BonkBot as more of a wallet and the non-custodial feature they will add is further along this line of thinking.\n",

      "Bonk Bot\n",
      "• Main focus right now is keeping the bot alive.\n",
      "• <https://dune.com/whale_hunter/bonkbot> - 1% fee on trade value. revenue is 50% of actual.\n",
      "• Bonk bot has no features. Their edge is that they come from the degen world in Solana and they have strong meme skills.\n",
      "• They have weekly Twitterspaces where they feature tokens and then burn about $5k worth.\n",
      "• Profit margin is 99%. All of their treasury and profit is in BONK and they havenʻt taken personal profit yet.\n",
      "• Bonk Bot users set huge slippage when trading because they just want execution and view trade as either a 0 or a ginormous EV.\n",
      "• Their customers are pro traders and retail that are just punting. Avg trade size is $10k+.\n",
      "Solana meme coin landscape\n",
      "• Solana is very culty with most traders in AsylumDAO. Unibot created a Solana version with more features than BonkBot and the Solana degens rejected it because it wasnʻt Solana.\n",
      "• A cabal of CT Solana influencers determine which tokens to meme. They usually look for tokens that developers have exited and takeover the token and run the meme.\n",
      "• Most memecoin teams are sketchy and not good people.\n",
      "• Unibot Solana was created by a contractor team and Unibot has split from the Solana version.\n",
      "• Solana bot is the #2 tg bot but itʻs known for wash trading.\n",
      "MEV post-Jito mempool\n",
      "• Jito still does bundle auctions. Solanaʻs priority is users which is why they told Jito to shutdown mempool because users were complaining of sandwiching.\n",
      "• Bundle time ~ 200ms. BB could bundle similar to jaredfromsubway.eth and they are thinking of extracting the MEV and sharing back with their users.\n",

      "• They were not expecting their success and have no roadmap or analytics. They would be happy to give log data to FB data team for analytical help.\n",
      "• Currently evaluating whether they 1) continue this project and add features or 2) they find an exit with the least brain damage as possible (Tina is brokering a deal).\n",
      "• Worried about regulatory and will release a non-custodial feature in the next few weeks that should eliminate most legal liability.\n",

      "• Profit margin is 99%. All of their treasury and profit is in BONK and they havenʻt taken personal profit yet.\n",
      "• Bonk Bot users set huge slippage when trading because they just want execution and view trade as either a 0 or a ginormous EV.\n",

      "• Katia thinks there will be major changes coming to the aggregator space as trading moves cross chain. Players that will take marketshare will have really good tech or bizdev.\n",
      "    ◦ 0x is becoming irrelevant. Trading a large universe of tokens requires a lot of resources.\n",
      "    ◦ Paraswap has stronger routing and engineering and should survive.\n",
      "    ◦ Lifi is really strong in bd.\n",
      "    ◦ Hashflow has strong bd with market makers. They raised at the right time but considers their product underwhelming given a 25mm raise. Hashflow isnʻt multi token to multi token.\n",
      "• Bebop is considering a TG mini app so that they can embed social and execution together. But self custody is the biggest issue.\n",
      "• They want to make the best RFQ system and feel that their new smart contracts will be a game changer with positive slippage.\n",
      "• Looking for a big name integration. They recently launched a partnership with Lido.\n",
      "• They are looking to create a reputation system for solvers and want to shed light on the flow from quote-to-execution. Current problems are 1) slippage is not measured and 2) there are no records of quotes onchain.\n",
      "• The major bottlenecks are 1) slippage varies for different coins, 2) the duration of live quotes varies, and 3) how to calculate trade impact from a DEX with no order book.\n",
      "L2 thoughts\n",
      "• Expansion into L2s is difficult since most of the liquidity is on Mainnet. Arbitrum is seeing more liquidity in ARB, ETH, and stables.\n",
      "• Smaller market makers trade only 10-15 coins.\n",
      "• Bebop is looking at Scroll and Katia likes the Scroll team.\n",
      "• For cross-chain expansion, they will either need to use a messaging protocol or partner with a cross-chain project (i.e. Matcha route). They are looking to build a proof-of-concept first.\n",

      "• 5 engineers for Bebop. Wintermute < 100 people. Bebop is not too connected to Wintermuteʻs operations.\n",
      "SUAVE\n",
      "• SUAVE could potentially provide a solution for the solver reputation system but there is only 1 SUAVE developer at Wintermute.\n",
