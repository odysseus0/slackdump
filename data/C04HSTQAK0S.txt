Dedicated channel for ecosystem inbound / outbound. <@U03GRQX5HGR> let me know if you want a dedicated workspace on notion or how i can help coordinate. I will go out and grab some of the recent threads but welcome others to do so as well.

Let's for now throw them all on a new notion database, with addition of simple tags like "L2" "wallet" "searcher/executor"
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 06/01/2023 13:44:07 Z:
|   I would recommend using the same notion database for investors just add two new columns: ecosystem/vc, L2/wallet/searcher/validator/other? Benefits:
• Cross reference: VCs recommend ecosystem projects in investor bundles
• Harder to merge databases later than start with the same ones?
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 06/01/2023 13:50:01 Z:

can do something useful with it later

I am going to decommission this channel at the end of day Monday. It sounds like the <#C03J71SFRUH|> channel serves this purpose already. Please let me know if there is disagreement.

For the ecosystem workstream I will need an ecosystem channel, please let me which one you think we should use. The partners channel hasn't been active for a while. You call <@U03TG3UMZFD>

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 12/01/2023 09:03:21 Z:
I remember we ended up not partnering closely with Skip because we felt we may end up competing with Suave, but as I think about it more I'm not 100% sure I know where the competition would be.

What kind of behaviour/business models would we consider competing with Suave as opposed to working in synthesis. It feels as though the avenues along we would clash with entities is those offering avenues for preference expression and execution markets. If skip is mostly doing the execution side, they should naturally plug into suave no?

> Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 12/01/2023 09:07:15 Z:
Definitely agree with the sentiment there. Every single angel investor and projects I talk to for the ecosystem alignment round literally can be perceived as competitive to SUAVE in some light.

Flashbots fails our mission from the onset of we cannot differentiate our market position vs. the rest of the ecosystem. 

If we actually believe we are competing with Skip and the likes, we will never achieve our potential and be respected at Ethereum or Cosmos caliber.

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 12/01/2023 09:27:02 Z:
Maybe once the suave technical spec if out we can have a more precise idea of projs we might end up competing with due to overlap and re-engage projs we find we actually aren't competing with

<@U03FQH1553P> and I had a long discussion with Ben Fisch from Espresso today which was more research/suave focused. However from a partnerships perspective the tl;dr is that Espresso is trying to build decentralised sequencing as a service for rollups. The idea is that rollups would leverage the espresso validator set to do their sequencing (i.e. espresso is sequencing for a bunch of domains). Fortunately for us, he is very open to the idea of the sequence of txns being agreed upon by the espresso validators being given/influenced by something like Suave. Will continue to discuss with him - we didn't even get through all of suave (many many questions)

Let's use ecosystem channel for all partnership discussions, including the ones we will be having 1:1s with during ETHDenver, such that everyone can have visibility. This is the latest *<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HIU1mv6nE73rN3lUQpkRF6LUkoLE2sRc20RD0V17IA/edit?usp=sharing|guest list>* (most have reached out to me to attend or help with our mev research-athon) we drafted for ETHDenver (this list will be updated live, each day), and here is the database for <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/OFA-Meetings-ETH-Denver-e0756553df2e462b8b894811591e14fc|ETHDenver call prep/notes>.
• <@U03G59ZN90D> will be doing a series of 1:1s for OFA user research starting Tue, Feb 8, starting by the low priority convos that can help scope out the lay of the land, I will be there for the first few meetings, and <@U04QCPQ0CG5> will support and provide feedback throughout.
• <@U03PZSSETQA> will join for the high priority 1:1s (marked 1 on guest list sheet) during Mar 2-5.
• There may be a few strategic ecosystem partners (i.e. Phantom, 0x) who are important for our fundraise and OFA adoption, we may invite <@U02CJ9QVAL9> if time allows.
<@U03G59ZN90D> for your reference, this is what we find to work well for the fundraising workstream:
• Each morning: daily readout of who we meet, why they are interesting, specific tactics
• Huddle (live feedback of everyone one the call): immediately after the call (we only schedule 45min or 25min calls, thus have at least 5-15min after each call) to recap and for constant feedback.
• EOD: daily recap of each meeting and next steps
(cc. <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03QCGC3SL9> <@U03TD87PTMK> <@U03TG3UMZFD> <@U03FP0H62HH>)

|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> two potential add suggestions for the guest list- Steve Ellis from Chainlink will be in Denver those days (no one from their research team plans to attend unfortunately) and Mark Tyneway from Optimism (has been thinking about decentralized sequencer design, came up at the DBA session)
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 24/02/2023 21:12:12 Z:
|   Sounds good to me. Mark Tynesway is an OG pirateship friend, we will definitely hang out and invite him and optimism folks to the appropriate sessions we have!
For Steve - can you share more on Steven's role, whether he is technical or strategic? Thanks!
|   
|   > Sarah Allen [U03UY83AGUQ] @ 24/02/2023 21:13:07 Z:
|   Steve is the CTO and cofounder- currently runs their engineering team. He's super high context across their org and a great person to talk research ideas with
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 24/02/2023 21:13:24 Z:
|   amazing! how MEV sophisticated is he?
|   
|   > Sarah Allen [U03UY83AGUQ] @ 24/02/2023 21:14:23 Z:
|   very high context and would be up to speed immediately, but he doesn't give talks, so suggesting him as a group participant not speaker
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 24/02/2023 21:14:55 Z:
|   perfect! is he aware of our OFA work?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 24/02/2023 21:15:00 Z:
|   Ah <@U03UY83AGUQ> steve is a good call! Wonder if it makes sense to talk with him about OFA
|   Can you remind me if he’s in NY?
|   
|   > Sarah Allen [U03UY83AGUQ] @ 24/02/2023 21:16:27 Z:
|   he's NYC based yes <@U03PZSSETQA>, <@U03GRQX5HGR> he attended the SBC event and has read the posts in the meantime I expect, but don't think he has any internal Flashbots OFA intel

Interesting person to talk to: *Keone Hon*

• current: cofounder of monad, who is building an L1 that is EVM-compatible and can do 10k tps using EVM parallelization and efficient state access
• prev: jump crypto team lead of research engineers working on defi
• prev: team lead of jump’s hft team for 8 years — performance optimization, low-latency, ML
<@U03FP0H62HH> see you’re an investor in Monad — if we aren’t already connected, can you connect?
<@U03G0PNEV0E> have you looked into this?

If he’s in denver, would love to chat with him and invite him to latency panel. cc <@U03GRQX5HGR>
|   
|   > alex [U03ERC46NKA] @ 26/02/2023 19:54:07 Z:
|   We were hanging out with him in April of last year at DevConnect :) he came to our dinner after MEV Day
|   not sure if makes sense to invite him to latency panel depending on what latency you’re talking about but he’s still cool
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 26/02/2023 20:01:05 Z:
|   I wonder why with this profile they don’t start with searching + blockbuilding first
|   
|   > alex [U03ERC46NKA] @ 26/02/2023 20:02:28 Z:
|   parallelisation is also smth Jump developed internally iirc and ig thesis is similar to Fuel’s  (which makes sense) 
|   I’m interested in MEV-driven parallelisation :smiling_imp:  tried to pill Ansgard on the topic last week 
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 26/02/2023 20:03:57 Z:
|   tbh i’m not that familiar with the latency landscape either — but all these hft firms like citadel and jump all appear to have “low-latency” teams. is there anywhere i can read up on your recent insights/knowledge of this area? <@U03ERC46NKA>
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 26/02/2023 20:09:58 Z:
|   Oh this guy, didn’t we have dinner with him in amsterdam?
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 26/02/2023 20:16:51 Z:
|   I'm happy to intro you any time. Don't think there's room for a partnership at this stage, since they are 9+ months from main net + they are low on the priority list + harder to integrate with as a builder

But ofc exchange of info can make a lot of sense and Keone is always open to that in my experience
|   
|   > alex [U03ERC46NKA] @ 26/02/2023 20:39:33 Z:
|   <@U03G59ZN90D> parallelised EVM can help with simulation latency, it’s a different kind of latency than communication latency eg
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 26/02/2023 20:40:13 Z:
|   ah yes — my understanding is that they do both
|   
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 26/02/2023 20:43:18 Z:
|   this is the profile of the low latency communication work they do — <https://boards.greenhouse.io/monad/jobs/4116720005>
|   
|   > alex [U03ERC46NKA] @ 26/02/2023 20:47:46 Z:
|   my only public thoughts on latency in the context of mev boost are here: 
<https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/111|https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/111>
<https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/112|https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/112>
|   yes <@U03G59ZN90D> low-latency here is about simulation latency (executing many txs in parallel), also why you’d use c++ :) 
|   I don’t think they work on communication latency like Jump would, on micro towers for eg
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 26/02/2023 20:50:18 Z:
|   ahhh okay this makes sense — ty!
|   
|   > alex [U03ERC46NKA] @ 26/02/2023 20:52:15 Z:
|   happy to talk more but idk if I’d spend a lot of time on Monad, def intellectually interesting tho! 

worth understanding where latency shows up in our systems & as problem statements in order to guide discussions 
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 26/02/2023 21:20:35 Z:
|   Monad is running a highly customized version of Tendermint consensus, so they are def optimizing on latency
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 27/02/2023 04:57:30 Z:

cold outreach template to spam the ecosystem with the happy hour invite, plus invite them to jam on MEV / OFA. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Cold-Outreach-e6b7c053498544aba97f4de698fe548f> <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03G59ZN90D> if you have a calendly you are using to schedule your office hour chats this week, LMK and we can add it to this template. Feel free to edit as you see fit.

Disclaimer, there is a link to the SUAVE spec, but it will not be available to most people (until we add them to cloudflare). I expect some gatekeeping to arise and will gladly middle man it, if people request access.

We're sharing the SUAVE spec so broadly now that it's kinda bad, people are gonna feel uncool if they haven't seen it

|   It has not gone out yet <@U02CJ9QVAL9>. Will remove the spec link. It’s a short list of who has access currently if you reference <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/SUAVE-SPEC-Access-3f0e0e0662674905b0e2ca9f644698b5|https://www.notion.so/flashbots/SUAVE-SPEC-Access-3f0e0e0662674905b0e2ca9f644698b5>

|   I think if you want you should share it <@U03TG3UMZFD>. No harm in sharing it marginally more
|   My meta point is just that we should publish the spec 
|   Since it’s going out in private quite a bit 
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 01/03/2023 02:02:02 Z:

<@U03G59ZN90D> Have we reached out to Lucas from Jump to schedule a meeting? I think that was initially <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C04HSTQAK0S/p1677501982590489|planned> for tomorrow but don’t see a status update on the master spreadsheet. If we haven’t already reached out, perhaps it makes sense for <@U02CJ9QVAL9> to reply directly (since Lucas had reached out over dm initially). Don’t want to duplicate efforts if this already underway though. Lmk!
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 01/03/2023 18:10:45 Z:
|   This was planned to be after the panel. <@U03PZSSETQA>
|   It's already underway...
|   I will ask again, in the group, they are literally on the panel
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 01/03/2023 18:14:54 Z:
|   Could you keep the spreadsheet up to date with what outreach is underway <@U03GRQX5HGR>? I think some of the confusion is coming from some people not having a status update if they’ve been reached out to :)
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 01/03/2023 18:15:34 Z:
|   They are in the process of responding - I can only run them once or twice updated.
|   Logistics wise simplest is to ping me
|   Fyi this is how generally roadshow arrangements are done - there's no way to keep "real time" updates because lags in response time, just clear ownership is sufficient.
|   Unless someone owns it end to end, it's much more chaotic to midway crowd sourced because there's order of operations and also I am chasing you all for each of the scheduling (honestly I hate this work but someone needs to do it right and thoroughly without conflicts), and there are multiple of you!
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 01/03/2023 18:20:45 Z:
|   Ps. We run a 30min sync each morning, to go over things that need to be followed up, so you are more than welcome to join us in morning sync to get context. <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA>
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 01/03/2023 18:20:56 Z:
|   Sorry Tina - I mean just to flag on the spreadsheet that someone has actioned and reached out to a person.
|   A handful already have that on the spreadsheet.
|   Don’t expect real time. Maybe the answer is that all of the names on that sheet have been actioned and it’s cool. But a few names having “reached out” and others being blank confused us!
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 01/03/2023 18:29:28 Z:
|   We are keeping a close tap on people who are strategic, just trust they will be done, if they are not filled out - it's in process, or it's no longer important due to assessment.
This goes again into - it's hard to both in drivers seat and in perfect shape update. There's a lot going on, but we all are adults and will execute, in our judgement what makes the most sense.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 01/03/2023 18:32:11 Z:
|   <@U03G59ZN90D> at the end of each day, please complete your update in the sheet, imo for actual coordination with third parties - calendar invites are most effective, so I will focus on that and only use the sheet to check for priority updates, and other invitations.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 01/03/2023 19:13:30 Z:
|   i am updating the spreadsheet with people i have reached out to!
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 01/03/2023 21:57:44 Z:
|   Sounds like you have it covered — great!

A few follow-ups on outreach/adoption tactics
<@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> 
• <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA> what are the Coinbase Wallet friend's response if any - are there anyone strategically important, or insightful on CB wallet product at ETHdenver? Charlie mentioned yesterday he can ask fred for the top down intro, but let's see what they say based on our personal connection? 
• <@U03G59ZN90D> based on your latest research and feedback, do you still want to talk to Blur? 
• <@U03G59ZN90D> for cowswap, it may be effective to go to their dinner tonight first, where you can literally talk to someone from their team for hours and figure out who are the most insightful, I'm wondering if it would be high ev to do 1:1 - in cowswap case 1:1 I think entails more direct collaboration rather exploration cuz we already know each other so well, and they are also coming to our happy hour tomorrow... Just some food for thoughts in terms of tactics. 
• <@U03G59ZN90D> any update from Opensea protocol team 0age and co? I pinged Devin finzer he hasn't responded - not sure if they are already in off-site mode or not... 
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 01/03/2023 19:24:43 Z:
|   yes blur still interesting to talk to
|   yup, signed up for their dinner
|   no update from opensea
|   will reach out
|   also wanted to meet will price — dming him now, saw he registered for latency happy hour
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 01/03/2023 19:25:51 Z:
|   I think you are looking for cowswap mysterious data scientist right ? I bet he's at the dinner too ;)
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 01/03/2023 19:25:57 Z:
|   think he would have good insighta
|   yup’
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 01/03/2023 19:26:13 Z:
|   Oh you haven't met him? Do you wanna interview him?
|   I know him pretty well from pirateship - can just arrange
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 01/03/2023 19:26:37 Z:

|   Coinbase has a happy hour Saturday Night that I can get 1 person an invite for if they would like -- might be place to chat with CB Wallet.
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 01/03/2023 21:08:05 Z:
|   0age isn't in Denver but is down for a call next week tho
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 01/03/2023 21:54:20 Z:
|   I haven’t heard back from coinbase

|   Nor have I
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 01/03/2023 21:57:31 Z:
|   I believe some of them are in an offsite today… if that provides any clarity.

<@U03PZSSETQA> what time do you land on Thursday, and when do you expect to get to the Denver venue? 
• We have total of only 3 viable timeslots on Thursday left, need to figure out which slot goes to whom. 
• Jump can confirm a session that's 11:30 or 12noon (after the panel), would you mind if we just meet then and share with u the notes, or do you prefer to push it till you arrive? 
• Blocknative is available 2:00pm or 2:30pm at their booth, but waiting for confirmation when your flight lands and get to the Venue. 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 01/03/2023 21:51:54 Z:
|   I’ll be available after 2pm on thursday
|   Can go either way re:jump. If I’m not there I recommend <@U02CJ9QVAL9> joins in my place (lucas originally reached out to him so seems to make sense)

> Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 03/03/2023 00:26:25 Z:
<@U03FP0H62HH> I met with Walshy at walletcon, who takes care of direct wallet integrations for Lido. Could you connect me? He’s great for getting a view of the wallet landscape.

He gave me the following data about wallets:
• metamask: 30m across mobile and extension
• trust wallet: 10m just introduced browser extension 
• coinbase wallet: claudia, the lead, said less than a million
• rainbow: 50,000
Hungry players who quickly integrated lido: 
zerion
ambire
atomic wallet 
argent
myetherwallet
phantom
metamask
infinity
kucoin
okex

|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 03/03/2023 01:22:25 Z:
|   I can connect you to him if Hasu hasn’t yet. I spent a lot time exploring lidos referral program with him and jbeezy their bd lead 
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 03/03/2023 01:34:30 Z:
|   Fwiw, Robinhood has 20m, brave and opera have >2m last we spoke. He probably has an updated list now.

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 03/03/2023 06:58:34 Z:
|   Oh thanks <@U03TG3UMZFD> , can you do that? I actually don’t have Walshy’s connect, would first have to ask for an intro myself 
|   but this sounds like a great connection <@U03G59ZN90D> 
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 03/05/2023 11:23:26 Z:
|   <@U03TG3UMZFD> could you create a group with <@U03PZSSETQA> and I with Walshy?

|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 03/05/2023 18:26:39 Z:
|   doesnt appear eager to leverage his connections. who do you want connected with? I can ask jbeezy who leads lido BD
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 03/05/2023 18:29:45 Z:
|   Still finalizing but there are a bunch of wallets in the second tab here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1216xycEOxueLoikW4EgB9wSt7_7mWvhGNYSs8H5IpRQ/htmlview#|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1216xycEOxueLoikW4EgB9wSt7_7mWvhGNYSs8H5IpRQ/htmlview#>

Plus i think a few extras that angela mentioned above
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 03/05/2023 18:29:50 Z:
|   he sent me a dm that basically says that. he was softer in our group chat
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 03/05/2023 18:30:12 Z:
|   Gotcha, sounds like this is a dead end?
|   We can polish our list tomorrow when we sync about adoption and maybe pick off a few to ask him about more targetedly
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 03/05/2023 18:32:45 Z:
|   i think he may have an nda or non-compete in exchange for severance. probably unsure what hes allowed to say / do
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 03/05/2023 18:33:20 Z:
|   Well glad we figured that out quickly!
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 03/05/2023 18:38:37 Z:
|   jbeezy is dope and would have the same rolodex if there is anyone we cant locate, but the missing links on your list are pretty small? Ledger, Keystone, Coin98, Zapper, Curve? None of those are out of reach. Just let me know what / when you want it actioned.

> Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 07/03/2023 23:29:10 Z:
<@U03GRQX5HGR> I'm guessing you want to be a part of this conversation because of fundraising? Catherine is the PM at Coinbase Wallet responsible for their swaps product - she was super excited to talk to us asap about mev-share.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 07/03/2023 23:31:04 Z:
|   My read was that this call would be fairly tactical, us explaining mev share, getting to know the right ppl to jam with, but not sure who would be involved in “a bunch if coinbase folks”
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 07/03/2023 23:31:54 Z:
|   Given there's Coinbase investment negotiation going on, I suggest we get clarity there
|   I thought about this point specifically fwiw <@U02CJ9QVAL9>
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 07/03/2023 23:32:58 Z:
|   Clarity where
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 07/03/2023 23:33:37 Z:
|   What's the purpose of the call, who are other "Coinbase people involved "
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 07/03/2023 23:35:23 Z:
|   She had mentioned someone on her team who “loves tinkering with early MVPs” and is crypto native. My hope would be that we meet them and perhaps some others who would be involved in mev share — but she said “mev” generally in the note 
|   
|   > metachris [U03G3CSRBQR] @ 08/03/2023 09:27:37 Z:
|   If this person is called "Theo Powers", then I'd recommend to be a bit careful and suspicious. He's behind <http://usemerkle.com|usemerkle.com> but seems a bit shady with the branding. He also announced a builder with kickbacks and airdrop (and I've heard he's raising a seed round without his colleagues being aware of it :thinking_face:). Might not be him after all, but he's somewhat active in our shared Discord and I'm getting weird vibes.

|   Yeah it’s on a monday lol. I’d like to have more advance prep than the day of — can find time prior fri or thurs
|   Do we need to include everyone on the invite (phil/hasu?)
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 09/03/2023 22:17:10 Z:
|   Fri sgtm, should work with the steward onsite I thinj? don't need to invite Phil (optional tho), should probably add Hasu

|   <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> we had a call with Coinbase Ventures today (<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Coinbase-5001ca199653424fbe9acf8f52868d36|notes>). We can confirm that Coinbase Ventures makes independent decisions (they talk to their business units but makes their own judgement), hence we can separate our Flashbots/Coinbase interface into fundraising and adoption workstream. 
Let’s aim to sync on Monday morning ET if you have time - will give some thoughts and clarity around adoption tactics and triage workflow across all ecosystem partners. (Cc. <@U03QCGC3SL9> <@U03TG3UMZFD> <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FP0H62HH> )

<@U03G59ZN90D> re Coinbase's wallet as a service, I'd already made a task in strategy task management system to look into it. If you want, I'm just gonna go ahead and optimisically assign this to you, and when you do look into it you can use that
<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Strategy-Tasks-e8f245ea265e4ae1aeb0844d5e522376?p=ccba9f24544f42f9acd6abbef7763f5c&pm=s>

|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 09/03/2023 21:21:33 Z:
|   FYI this’ll have to take lower priority to some of the other work angela is up to right now for MEV share
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 10/03/2023 06:42:43 Z:
|   yeah nw, its low priority, but we should have a sense before talking to them next week

*What’s the best way to confidentially share information from our conversations with searchers?* <@U03G59ZN90D> pointed out to me that the notes from these convos are sensitive. But we do want to be able to share the learnings from them.

Straw person ideas
• Create code names for each searcher
• Take inspo from “sensitive data mates” -> “sensitive info mates”
• Is it possible to permission a notion doc in a shared space to only be visible to a specific group of people? Would be easier for all our notes to live in one place, but for only a subset of FB to be able to see the searcher convos (we have external folks in our notion that we wouldn’t want to accidentally leak this to)
<@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03QCGC3SL9> interested in your thoughts!
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 09/03/2023 22:37:23 Z:
|   I don't feel super strongly here, we could have a dedicated notion space for sensitive info / a sensitive and non-sensitive set of notes or something like that.

To your point you _can_ permission notion docs to be visible to arbitrary sets of people.

I think searchers are more concerned about alpha leaking than anything else (which is an argument that codenames don't work)
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 09/03/2023 22:38:41 Z:
|   Yes we can make a sensitive notion page and some already exist. 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 09/03/2023 22:40:35 Z:
|   If possible my preference would be for everything to live in the same space, just have some docs be more tightly locked down
|   Ack re: codenames
|   How do we restrict access on a doc that’s in a public place?
|   
|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 10/03/2023 00:45:58 Z:
|   Click share button and toggle permissions. Remove flashbots, add accessible parties

|   Flagging that <@U03G59ZN90D> made us a special page for our searcher convos and added all the appropriate perms :heart: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Searcher-Interviews-71a4752df5bd4670ac64ad4da996309c>

Ty angela!!
|   
|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 13/03/2023 21:06:25 Z:
|   nice! :heart:  how are we thinking about setting permissions on this information w/in product? Community, etc? Do people who want access (or future DB or BD/adoption hires) need to chat with Angela? Don’t want it to become a black box :slightly_smiling_face:
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 13/03/2023 21:50:39 Z:
|   So I think any of us who currently have access can add someone else. That seems reasonable to me — won’t be blocked just on her and we can all use our judgement

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 09/03/2023 22:14:53 Z:
Flagging that I met someone working at Amber group who run a cyrpto exchange and market make in asia if we ever need an intro. (although we probably already have better connections - this is not a high level person)
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 10/03/2023 01:09:20 Z:
|   Yes we are connected to Amber Group. Do we want to interview them for OFA market research? <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> 
Do we think they are good investors to have on our cap table as part of ecosystem? <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03ERC46NKA>
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 10/03/2023 06:47:45 Z:
|   I know very little about them.
they incubated Rook fyi
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 10/03/2023 06:52:48 Z:
|   I didn't know they have such large ownership!
What do we think about other ofas on our cap table?
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 10/03/2023 06:53:33 Z:
|   pls don't rely on this info :slightly_smiling_face: but they spun out Rook, and Rook doesn't have much inflation
|   
|   > alex [U03ERC46NKA] @ 10/03/2023 08:11:10 Z:
|   I like Amber Group :) could ask Paradigm for reference since they’re an investor 
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 10/03/2023 08:19:04 Z:
|   I asked someone at Amber to confirm: they are no longer a big shareholder in Rook

<@U03G59ZN90D> Do you want to be added to an alchemy group? It sounds like they are keen to "collab" at least thats wha their VC arms says. Sounds like an open door.

|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 17/03/2023 18:09:06 Z:
|   yes its the fundraising group with their ventures team. it sounds like you already have the right group lined up. I will tell the ventures that and ask if they had any other suggestions for ways to "collab"
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 17/03/2023 18:10:42 Z:
|   sure — please add me to any of these groups for shared context. should i be adding you to all the product related tg groups? (i have only been adding tina so far)

My takeaways from BD sync w investment and product teams:
• we need an investment <> product interface which currently does not formally exist
• the following needs were surfaced:
Investment -> product:
• information updates: latest specs, changes in direction, what can be shared vs cannot
• market data (marketshare)
• relationship data (collaboration depth, existing state of product integrations)
Product -> investment:
• which projects are investors, being considered for investment, in the progress of getting investment
I think both needs can be solved with:
(1) single unified CRM
(2) mutual addition to communication channels for shared context and easy tagging
(3) short weekly status updates
• from investment: what targets are lined up for this week (eg call w polygon)
• from product: what changed from last week to this
For (1), both sides should start by taking some time to think through what is needed, and then listing them <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Unified-CRM-Requirements-d9567618fda84ad28a592419671725b6?pvs=4|here>. <@U03TG3UMZFD> check out the <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/OFA-Stakeholder-Database-CRM-ba7d4a028bd348a9943c42d4e23c4f55?pvs=4|OFA stakeholder database>. Then we can decide which CRM to inherit and what structural changes need to be made.
For (2), <@U03TG3UMZFD> you can start by adding me and I can respond with product context when tagged and also make sure the information being relayed re: product is up to date and correct.
For (3), <@U03TG3UMZFD> can own the weekly update and I think <@U03PZSSETQA> should give the product updates in this channel.

Generally, what’s most important is to maintain alignment on the partners that overlap in the diagram below.

Note: For the single unified CRM, I think that the knowledge sharing needs extend beyond just investment and product, and I would like research and strategy teams to commit as well. For example, Sarah Allen is the closest node for chainlink. For example, the recent sequencing and 4337 meetings span across all 4 teams.

|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 17/03/2023 20:42:54 Z:
|   <@U03TG3UMZFD> lmk your preferences for adding you to the product groups.

whether it is purple only or red as well (diagram)
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 17/03/2023 21:44:19 Z:
|   Agree on improving our CRM and using it as the main nexus / interface!

I might suggest that rather than posting here every week, we maintain our doc of “product guidance” that explains what can be shared and where we’re at w various projects. Then we can flag here if we’ve made a notable change. But prob won’t happen every week so that just adds overhead imo
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 17/03/2023 21:44:47 Z:
|   ooo yes thats a good idea, lets do that <@U03PZSSETQA>
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 17/03/2023 21:45:15 Z:
|   Sweet, just thinkin of how we can keep the interface lightweight so that if you do get tagged you know it’s important
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 17/03/2023 21:45:20 Z:
|   now that i think about it, fundraising has that too with their changelogged gameplan

> Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 17/03/2023 21:38:52 Z:
Thanks everyone for a great call earlier! Here are the actions we aligned on — let’s regroup in a week or so to review our progress
• Document how to triage inbound requests into categories and write up what the categories are — <@U03GRQX5HGR> will own this with support from <@U03G59ZN90D>. <@U04QCPQ0CG5> / <@U03TG3UMZFD> will remind Tina and keep her accountable
• Create guide from product for what can be shared w who (mev share, tech docs, what else) - <@U03PZSSETQA> and <@U02CJ9QVAL9> will own this with support/review from <@U04QCPQ0CG5> on language / comms. <@U03TG3UMZFD> please suggest any additional topics that you want us to give guidance on
• Propose new CRM format that has subpages, summary/vibes, and flags (eg. fundraising) — <@U03TG3UMZFD> and <@U04QCPQ0CG5> will own
• When we know what the testnet will look like and what the categories are for interactions, we should create a nice tracker that shows where a given actor is in the funnel (what of our products do they use, how far along are they in integrating with XYZ product)
• Product will add Tina + Danny to meeting invites if it seems funraising sensitive. This is the best way to inform them that it’s happening. They will reach out if there’s anything we need to know in advance of that call.

*Reviewing the polygon channel*, it looks like they lack most context and engagement regarding SUAVE. Our last meaningful engagement was on Feb 17 with JD <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Polygon-2464db928ba44ce0b27d715e18253c6b?pvs=4|here>. Since then  JD, mihailo, and mkisin were granted suave spec access but it doesn’t look like they were notified or engaged about it. 

TLDR; they are pilled. They engaged twice since our last call, one to talk SUAVE, which looks like we didn’t ? And another on the new espresso sequencer post.

<@U03G59ZN90D> how do you want to engage ? We can start with sharing the massive amount of blog posts and content they may not have seen? My recommendation would be to drip the most relevant posts into the channel. Then if you still  want them in testnet we can schedule with JD and his team for the next week or 2 to discuss what your goals are. 

To be clear, we have separately engaged the ventures team in another channel for fundraising. We think there may be a long shot the foundation / jd invests directly but that’s ancillary. If we want to engage them on SUAVE we can strategize slow drips until you are ready or something quicker and biased towards actions. Up to you. 

I will wait to drip or engage until we define our sharing process this week from the bd sync.

|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 21/03/2023 18:59:03 Z:
|   IMO, polygon and other domains are interesting to product for:
• *mev-share adoption*
    ◦ low fee environment enables more and higher kickbacks
    ◦ easier searcher adoption — I believe we are close with Thogard and convincing thogard to integrate mev-share appears easier than convincing SCP
• *cross-domain orderflow*
    ◦ _provides a consistent kickback service for wallets who are all multichain_ 
    ◦ on par with other OFAs which are heavily multichain (0x is on 8 chains)
    ◦ a great in towards cross-domain orderflow, a necessary component to our decentralized block builder, and flashbots brand/presence/legitimacy, and paves the path towards adoption of our other products — EVM chains (L2s, polygon) all do not have a “flashbots-copycat” ala skip/jito
For specific polygon engagement, I think two things are needed first:
• lay of the land of polygon mev
• what building a mev-share kickback system on a chain without mev-boost looks like
Since this is a high priority yet low context partner for us, I would not suggest to drip them something like the mev-share spec. I would rather go to them with a targeted document that says — this is what mev-share would look like on polygon at a technical level, this is the opportunity and the narrative + kickback amount you can market to your users, this is what we need from you all and what partnership would entail (eg marketing/connections), phantom and rainbow are our wallet partners, and thogard is our searcher partner. Then schedule a meeting to address questions and concerns.

If you add me to the chat though, happy to keep up to date on their activity and answer their questions.

Regarding MEV on polygon: Heres a fork of mev explore on polygon: <https://explore.marlin.org/#/>

FRP 24 is specifically focused on MEV on polygon, but there was apparently a bug which is causing delays (as of yesterday). I pinged Arthur directly about 2 weeks ago to see if he would give me a sneak peak on the data and he would not. Here's the <https://collective.flashbots.net/t/frp-24-quantifying-mev-on-l2s/450/31|forum post>

Generalizing the easily identified MEV from our FRPs and mev explore via Dex swaps.... theres roughly 10% of the <https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/polygon|volume> on Polygon but the Marlin Dashboard points toward around 1% of MEV on Ethereum. However its not clear that their fork is an apples to apples comparison.

That being said, we know MEV explore 1.0 bottom up approach is low. At least 6-7x low based on <@U03N9H4JP8C> mev explore 2.0 <https://data.flashbots.net/dashboard/138-mev-explore-v2-0>

Could rough estimate potentially 10-20M on polygon in the last 12 months with a couple of big assumptions. We can of course eagerly await FRP 24 to release.

After we have FRP 24, maybe we can help them iterate a 2.0 version like ours?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 21/03/2023 19:47:49 Z:
|   Uh, dumb question but are there… full block proposals on polygon? Builders?
|   If not then there’s some adjustment we’d need to make to the mev share implementation I think (ie. right now builders enforce kickbacks)
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 21/03/2023 19:50:07 Z:
|   if we drop the privacy requirement, we could just use double signing

users send us a worse acceptable signed tx or message

we double sign and send to mempool with a required kickback for inclusion

(similar to cowswap)
|   but yeah — this is stuff i would want to know for mev-landscape, are searchers still spamming? is there private deals with validators?
|   thogard has something called fastlane i havent looked into
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 21/03/2023 19:54:48 Z:
|   I’m hesitant to sink too much effort into polygon in the near term because
1. The tech is different and we may need to build a different implementation just for them
2. We need concentrated adoption on each chain for mev-share to be effective in that domain (ie. provide good kickbacks). Fragmenting our adoption efforts across multiple chains seems counterproductive before we have one flagship deployment that’s running very well
3. We don’t understand the ecosystem as well and would need to do more BD to get to the same level of insight we have right now on eth
I think it’s an interesting contender for something to explore later but there are a number of other things I would focus on first before devoting significant time here. Like our eth testnet adoption partners.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 21/03/2023 19:56:17 Z:
|   I agree with the need to focus and we should concentrate on one chain first. My argument above is there is a world where it may make sense to launch on polygon first, and a call w thogard to explore it should be enough to assess.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 21/03/2023 19:56:35 Z:
|   A single exploratory call seems like a low cost way to evaluate this!

|   
|   > alex [U03ERC46NKA] @ 21/03/2023 20:57:14 Z:
|   mev-share on polygon would need at least the concept of bundles to be added in & some notion of privacy? mb Fastlane can help altho i think they don’t have network-wide adoption? 

as i mentioned already somewhere else on here, i think we should consider shipping it as a 4337 bundler. it would circumvent the bundling problem & the mumbai testnet is the biggest 4337 testnet :) 
|   if not Flashbots, there will definitely be 4337-based OFAs and it sounds to me like they will have an advantage in domains where there is no existing mev infra?

*Ecosystem Content* 
<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Creating-an-Ecosystem-Resource-List-db275300d3794ef48a635633ea91aaa0|Ecosystem Resource List>
Finally had a chance to review our content that we are sharing (or could share). I started with content that I thought should be shared for our adoption strategy and then moved down to what is currently shared in the Dataroom for investors and then our deprecated "Beauty Contest".  It would be helpful if we worked through this in two steps.
1 - evaluate this ecosystem resource list wholistically. Are there obvious posts or content we are missing that we can add to it? I tried to organize by a few topics to guide them. Input is welcomed
2 - evaluate the versions / links included if you are aware of updated version or if one of these resources is deprecated in lieu of something totally new.

Note i excluded mev-boost, protect and mev-geth related content to contain the readers focus to MEV and SUAVE related content. I also limited the content to Flashbots original content. I am open to external content as well if there is consensus on it.

|   Great start Danny. I'm going to spend some time looking through this, I've got some other notion links that I think might be able to be added here too..

But the bigger question I think is external presentation which Is something I am thinking about now re: FB comms strategy. No answers yet, but getting closer.

Hi I started a “product guide to ecosystem interactions” with info on our products and what to share about them externally <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Product-Guide-for-Ecosystem-Engagements-1067e96764c4451399b1a1fff60b5498>

<@U02CJ9QVAL9> Can you add info on suave technical docs
<@U03TG3UMZFD> I didn’t see your resource list above until after I made this… happy to consolidate! It’s supposed to be useful to folks in coordination so please structure the content however you like. You can move it out of this doc and delete in favor of yours if that’s better.

What small, hungry wallets do we have the best impression of? (Thesis, bitkeep, …) — who do folks think would be best to target for mev-share?

I expect that we’ll have a few larger wallets that we focus most of our energy on as early partners (eg. CB wallet or phantom). But also want to start building conviction around what smaller players we could involve. My understanding is that there are a *lot* out there so would love some input to help us focus our energy here

*My 2 gwei on Polygon (and other rollups/domains)*
The cost of us running centralized infrastructure for other domains is very high (2-3 sr backend eng + 2-3 devops + research investment into MEV on that chain + BD to get adoption). We can't afford that at our size, and it's not playing to our strengths to copy/paste our infra on other domains. The path forward, imo, is for us to figure out how to scale our products across domains and let _others_ play that role instead. In other words, it's to focus one level of the stack up instead of on a given domain. In addition to orderflow sharing, and privacy, this is the need big frontier for product to figure out.

Very tactically this means:
• We get more clarity around what a SUAVE integration looks like for other domains
• We advocate that those teams support this integration with their validator/sequencer set
• We find teams that are willing to integrate with it and serve as early executors
• We explore potential franchising of our stack to these teams (e.g. Polygon fastlane franchises mev-share)
For Polygon, if we want to work closer to them, this means:
• We share SUAVE technical docs with the Polygon Team
• We tell them we're not ready to work with them yet, but would be in 3-6 months
• At that point we might have some asks of them to look into/support some integrations in how block production works (e.g. support mev-bor, support fastlane, add a mev-boost like API, whatever we want)
• We might have a similar ask of their rollups and we can flag that
• We might also ask them / their validator set to run an oracle on SUAVE and we can flag that
• We have *market research* calls with potential franchisees. It's important these are framed as *exploratory* and not seeking to establish a formal relationship. Frame the relationship as not seeking to compete with them, but enable them with SUAVE.
Repeat the same thing for other domains whenever we want to talk to them. Pretty skeptical that we should launch mev-share somewhere else first. Don't know the landscape enough to argue whether or not Thoghard and Fastlane are good candidates for mev-share today, but it's worth saying hi to them.

Somewhat wildcard on a medium term timeline is 4337, which I agree with have its own OFAs, and has nuanced integrations to L2s.

confirming call w thogard was exploratory, where i asked him questions about fastlane and we spoke about the mev landscape on polygon. no formal relationship or competitive tones.

|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 24/03/2023 00:00:52 Z:
|   yes it does, and i agree with next steps for polygon. i would suggest we move forward with that cc <@U03TG3UMZFD>

|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 24/03/2023 00:06:50 Z:
|   the positioning argument is something i have been thinking about, and i think if we find a way through here, it could be that 10x product.

all apps, wallets, node providers, ofas (0x, 1inch), searchers, and validators are multi-chain. is there a way for us to capture multichain orderflow without being multichain ourselves
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 24/03/2023 00:10:27 Z:
|   like you said, no clear idea here yet, but orderflow sharing, possibly 4337, and suave chain are relevant

|   I’m happy to push it forward with some relevant info but i don’t think we have as well defined a process for protect related partners. I believe they can freely integrate protect without any help, but maybe I have misread the ask here. 

Do they want an internal Flashbots person to champion them and encourage them? Easy enough for me to do if that’s all it takes.

|   > metachris [U03G3CSRBQR] @ 25/03/2023 14:25:19 Z:
|   > I believe they can freely integrate protect without any help
That's correct, and I don't think it would require any modifications on our end. A trial run is always good, and a direct technical contact, but no engineering efforts I see required from our end.

Depends where their protect requests would originate from, we may want to double-check the rate limits, and make some rules for them for higher volume, that's about it i think.
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 25/03/2023 15:38:49 Z:
|   Excellent. I will engage and encourage them. Will report back if they need rate limits adjusted

Hi I’m thinking of DMing a bunch of dapps to ask them about integrating with MEV-share. Partially to drum up interest and partially because we want to get their input on the best way for them to integrate. This is the game plan <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Dapp-adoption-game-plan-88d6d88faa6b42c984a21a94fee53830>

<@U03G59ZN90D> <@U03GRQX5HGR> Curious what you think of this plan? What’s your impression of the protocols I listed — what’s their vibe, any you would remove or add as initial outreach candidates

<@U03TG3UMZFD> <@U04QCPQ0CG5> FYI about some potential outreach. Would welcome your feedback as well.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 11/04/2023 02:28:04 Z:
|   Also plan to do this for wallets, but thinking that that can be in parallel with the launch rather than in advance of it because we have a slightly better sense of their requirements <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Wallet-adoption-game-plan-a6f6a7308ab44627b5f412a860146efc>
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 11/04/2023 11:13:18 Z:
|   i think talking with dapps is a great idea, i would approach it with a survey + research angle.

generically, i would want to talk about:
• thoughts on ofas on the market (shadow q: who they been in convos with)
• 4337
• get a pulse on their mev-awareness (thesis being mev minimization at app layer)
• give them context as to how searchers are interacting with their protocol today, and jam about privacy for mev minimization
the protocols you listed are correct (except sushi — who is less interesting to me), but each convo will be quite different. for example, balancer i would additionally want to ask about protect, 1inch is a lot more sensitive than others since they are sending exclusively to mevblocker, curve i would like to go much deeper into mev given the nuance of searcher integration and chat about what’s next as a parallel to their main competitor uniswap launching an rfq, and nfts is a completely different ofa and mev landscape.

since we are studying the protocol <> searcher interaction, to find the right privacy abstraction the research must be done hand in hand with searchers, so i will pair these with searcher conversations.

would prefer to own this then pass it off to you with the correct point of contacts and integration interface.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 11/04/2023 11:50:44 Z:
|   pinged balancer, opensea, and gem. 1inch imma speak to searcher contacts first to get a better idea of their power structure and strategy and find the right point of contact. also finding the right person at curve.

yearn is less interesting to me — their mev exposing transactions are deposits in and out of vaults and strategies, aka big swaps, so we can consider them a whale power user of dexes. they should be going through cowswap and they are, even participating as a solver because there is not enough solver competition at cowswap to get good execution.

<@U03TG3UMZFD> <@U04QCPQ0CG5>  for Tuesday MEV-share launch, by next Tuesday, we need to have onboarded two blockbuilders we are willing to share order flow with. By EOW next week, I wanna finish sweeping all searchers and wallets who are interested in our fundraise + important for mev-share adoption.

I would like to front load pitching the ones who expressed interest in investing with us, given we plan to sweep all target builders + searchers + wallets who may want to invest in us by EOW next week before our onsite, getting their indication of fundraising commitments as well as commitment to accept play nice be part of MEV share launch + be part of order flow working group. 

Here are the builders/searchers I'm planning to hit up to schedule for a call on Monday/Tuesday:
• Wintermute (rsync) - <@U03FP0H62HH> I think they expressed interest in investment to you first, would you prefer dm the right party to set up the pitch call (investment + orderflow sharing + working group)?
• SCP (Beaverbuild) - I will dm their partner Chris to set up the call with the right folks for (investment + orderflow sharing + working group)
• Builder69 - I will dm to coordinate (he's an investor to flashbots anyways, but he's probably not investing in fb this round)
Questions:
• Should we hit up jump crypto for investment? Or we don't want to due to reputation risks <@U03FP0H62HH> 
• Should we hit up searchers who are interested in series B investment for our working group (eg GSR, Grug? ) <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> 
• Before everything's finalized on mev-share, what product material (suave + mev-share + pitch material) can we share with these builders we are meeting on Monday / Tuesday? <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U03TG3UMZFD> 
• <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> we need to adapt our pitch and strategize on the pitch to builders and can emphasize the adoption context. 
• <@U03PZSSETQA> I would like to make sure 1-2 folks from the product org who will be focused on MEV share adoption can be on these calls. 
Wallets: 
• I will hit up the asian ones over the weekend, and set up proper telegram channels with us. However the goal is to reach out after the launch (when the blogpost, docs are all ready).
• Metamask + CB: will close the loop on investment next week, leveraging momentum on our launch.

|   I can join the calls if they’re at a reasonable hour EST. Later the better for me.

Product material — the mev-share spec from the valentine’s post on the forum, the “don’t be shady” agreement, need to think what else. Would certainly want to share our validity conditions API with them and maybe the whole new bundle spec because they have to implement it to receive our OF.

I’ll dm the CB wallet folks when it’s live, I think that’s the best channel bc have been talking with them somewhat regularly. Not sure we need to give advance notice?
|   Could send a screenshot of mev_sendBundle spec if we wanted

|   Happy to set up a group + meeting with Wintermute.

Jump crypto has so far been not been interested into operating on Ethereum, but we know they are lobbying L2s to adopt FCFS, so they can dominate the resulting latency game. I don't think that we can align them no matter what we do, but that doesn't mean that we should exclude them. What do you think?

Re searchers, I think we should definitely include them. Searchers are an underappreciated strategic resource for us, let's tighten that bond going forward.

Re pitch -- thinking about how to best pitch to searchers, I have some ideas (also shoutout to <@U03G0PNEV0E> + <@U03G59ZN90D> for discussing the topic with me)
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 14/04/2023 10:36:03 Z:
|   happy to jam more — i think the pitch to searchers/builders will be very different from all stakeholders so far. also a good exercise on what are the most valuable experiments to run and codesign with them
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 14/04/2023 10:39:50 Z:
|   yeah I might pick you up on that on Monday
|   let me compile my initial ideas
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 14/04/2023 13:32:04 Z:
|   Sounds like you have it all handled - let me know if you need any input

|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> FYI one other thing we could ask for when meeting with builders is to share certain data with us. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Builder-Scorecard-b1aed017ca364456a38e3e99e9052dfe?pvs=6&utm_content=b1aed017-ca36-4456-a38e-3e99e9052dfe&utm_campaign=T02CVA1G1H6&n=slack&n=slack_link_unfurl#034acee5f02146108736795522f0f76d|https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Builder-Scorecard-b1aed017ca364456a38e3e99e9052dfe?pvs=6&utm_content=b1aed017-ca36-4456-a38e-3e99e9052dfe&utm_campaign=T02CVA1G1H6&n=slack&n=slack_link_unfurl#034acee5f02146108736795522f0f76d>
|   So my asks for the monday meetings
• Invite them to working group
• Ask them if they want to share orderflow
• If so — must agree to not be sketchy, send us data^, and implement validity condition API
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 15/04/2023 09:01:48 Z:
|   <@U03FP0H62HH> We have a group with Wintermute (you are in it too). Is the person who initiated the conversation about investment in flashbots in the group already?
We also met the Wintermute team in ethdenver, and <@U03G59ZN90D> had been hanging out with them in London these weeks.

|   *Update on strategic partnership with builders pre MEV-share/Protect+  launch:*
• *SCP (Beaverbuild)* meeting tentatively confirmed for Monday 11am ET/3pm UTC <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> 
• *Wintermute (rsync)* meeting - waiting for <@U03FP0H62HH> on who is the right person from Wintermute (I assume the person who reached out to you a couple months ago is the right party) - <@U03FP0H62HH> please either directly find a time for us to chat with this person on Monday or Tuesday, or just let me and <@U03G59ZN90D> know and we can coordinate.
• *Builder69* - I will ping this weekend and set up a meeting, but need to noodle on the strategy a bit. <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U03HT20PJES> would be helpful to know how has our recent interaction with them gone so far, how have they behaved. I am hearing different things from us and from others whether they are trustworthy or not. 
With regard to meeting preparation, we need to handle each of these builders independently, I will incorporate your ask <@U03PZSSETQA> into drafted meeting prep notes, in the new CRM <@U03TG3UMZFD> please make sure they are ready by tomorrow.

|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> I cannot attend Monday's meeting with SCP unfortunately -- have an IRL responsbility interfering that makes me have to leave work at 10am ET. I should be good for the rest of the week.

I can submit some thoughts on how best to pitch them if that's useful?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 16/04/2023 13:44:22 Z:
|   Thx for letting me know, notes ahead would be helpful, I am also gonna try to reschedule to before 10am ET Monday, or Tuesday or Wednesday morning ET if possible.

|   <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA> there seems to be a Consensys meeting at the SCP suggested time that <@U03FP0H62HH> is also available - 15:00 UTC on Tuesday? Is there a way to move it? If not moveable, are you available at 15:30 UTC on Tuesday? 

_Note: I have asked this before, as a reminder - if there's a meeting with an external partner on our partnership list - please add me + <@U03TG3UMZFD> as optional so we can be aware of these schedules and can take that into account when we are in the process of consolidating strategic / product partnership workflow. We can stop doing this after we fully transition and set up the partnership workstream. This is important esp. this coming week, because we are raving against time to close high priority fundraising ecosystem partners before our onsite._ 
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 16/04/2023 13:55:45 Z:
|   I can ask Simon to move that. <@U03GRQX5HGR> the meeting in question is not about partnering, it's about exchanging some notes on erc-4337
|   Happy to add you as optional ofc
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 16/04/2023 14:03:27 Z:
|   Let's try shift the Tuesday Consensys meeting to other time next week to give priority to the SCP meeting, where <@U03FP0H62HH> your presence is critical for either the pitch or strategizing mev-share orderflow sharing and builder commitments... 
(Trying support <@U03PZSSETQA>'s target timeline: by Tuesday we align with key builders or at least get signal from them that we want included into the working group and for protect+ launch).
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 16/04/2023 14:22:59 Z:
|   <@U03TG3UMZFD> please let me know if you plan on further update today to the new consolidated CRM?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 16/04/2023 16:01:25 Z:
|   <@U03FP0H62HH> no need to change the Tuesday Consensys meeting with Simon - SCP can do Tuesday 15:30UTC - perfect timing
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 16/04/2023 16:19:28 Z:
|   The sooner we can talk to them the better; shifting one to Tuesday is okay but not ideal

We have our team sync at 16:00UTC, do I need to shift this to leave enough time or can we cover everything in 30min?
|   Do we have other builders lined up for monday yet?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 16/04/2023 16:22:15 Z:
|   We are waiting on Wintermute <@U03FP0H62HH> has contacted. I don't think we will be ready and aligned internally to talk to scp yet.
 I think we should focus on getting on the same page on monday. As I said, I do not expect SCP to immediately implement. The fastest builder is builder 69 imo.
|   Btw Justin Drake knows every builder - I will ask him to help set up meetings with some of the smaller builders.
(Having dinner with him and ultrasound team in 1.5 hours).
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 16/04/2023 16:27:23 Z:
|   Gotcha — let’s frontload b69 then?

The smaller builders are less important from the perspective of inclusion rates
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 16/04/2023 16:51:46 Z:
|   Strategically, I thought on thursday someone mentioned that we don't trust builder69 and SCP, hence we should frontload rsync/smaller builders/Bloxroute and Blocknative? Did I misheard this? <@U03PZSSETQA>
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 16/04/2023 17:26:36 Z:

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 16/04/2023 18:32:58 Z:
|   I should just message blocknative actually
|   I can do that ~now~ once we finalize DBS and the API
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 16/04/2023 19:10:29 Z:
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> Since people are opting into sharing with these builders I don’t think we have to have 100% trust. Instead we can establish reasonable expectations via the “don’t be sketchy” agreement but share more permissively due to the fact that users are explicitly asking to share

For that reason I’ve been prioritizing by inclusion rate
|   We get to decide who’s in the default set too; so it’s not as if just onboarding someone means we’ll recommend sharing with them
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 16/04/2023 19:16:02 Z:
|   Also this is the latest on my comms with b69, I think you were asking about that somewhere <https://discord.com/channels/755466764501909692/1042513215474651197>

> Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 15/04/2023 02:57:31 Z:
How should we track outreach etc around the mev share launch? Can we leverage the CRM? It would be helpful to have a view that’s specific to the mev-share launch so we know what status each partner is at, who has the latest touchpoint, any notes etc.

I’d also flag that if anyone receives inbound right now, the best response is to just let them know we’re working on a product that will launch next week. You can use the script from our <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Wallet-adoption-game-plan-a6f6a7308ab44627b5f412a860146efc|wallet adoption game plan> or whatever variant makes sense for the context:

```We're working on a new product that lets orderflow originators selectively share their transactions/information in exchange for better execution. It's in alpha right now and we're planning to launch on mainnet next week.```
And please flag (here / in whatever CRM system we devise)! This stuff can get fragmented fairly quickly. I don’t personally need to be added to every convo and would prefer we have some sort of triage system to avoid getting flooded :smile: But it would be helpful to be able to go to some place to see statuses

For MEV-Share specifically there is a new Project label in the main stakeholder crm. We made a related DB using the project tag and stakeholder name to avoid further dilution of the main DB. 

Should be a standard practice going forward. Here’s a page with the new DB. It’s also on the product home page under Business Development. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/MEV-Share-Adoption-71bd86efdf994e61b2bf6ec0a63700f8?pvs=4|https://www.notion.so/flashbots/MEV-Share-Adoption-71bd86efdf994e61b2bf6ec0a63700f8?pvs=4>

<@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> afaik Wintermute and maybe SCP were the market maker for imtoken swaps (built on top of 0x api), this is what i know of from a couple years ago, could be stale info, will ask for an update when i catch up with Ben.

> Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/04/2023 16:33:28 Z:
Here is my observations from these 2 _strategic partnership calls_ with key builder/searchers we are trying to align (the calls are quite successful in getting us what we want in the short term, great job team!):
• orderflow economy players are technical, familiar with our stack, but: 
    ◦ they lack understanding of how what we want them to do today lead to a decentralized future we preach
    ◦ they lack understanding of why a decentralized future can make the pie bigger from a rational actor pov
    ◦ they lack of understanding of SUAVE
• we are trying to ask them to do a bunch of things:
    ◦ reputable and technically capable builders: 
        ▪︎ Socially: Join the DOWG
        ▪︎ Socially/legally (?): Agree to FFMP in MEV-share repo (part of DOWG)
        ▪︎ Technically: integrate with our new API, to receive flow from our matchmaker
        ▪︎ Technically: provide feedback to MEV-share API design (???)
        ▪︎ Technically: provide data support or contribute to shared data initiatives that helps the market to self regulate (???)
    ◦ reputable and technically capable searchers: 
        ▪︎ Socially: Join the DOWG
        ▪︎ Technically: permissionlessly search on private flow from Flashbots matchmakers
        ▪︎ Technically: provide feedback to MEV-share API design (???)
        ▪︎ Technically: provide data support or contribute to shared data initiatives that helps the market to self regulate (???)
    ◦ on top of that, for the party who we want to align economically, we are asking their interest to invest in this round, cuz usually this will elevate/escalate the level of strategic mindshare we want, e.g. get to CEOs instead of local team members whom we already know
We would benefit from:
• A new succinct pitch for OF providers that outlines how do we go from MEV-share to SUAVE, how programmable privacy underpins our path from permissioned orderflow sharing today to a future of permissionless orderflow sharing in the SUAVE future. <@U03FP0H62HH> is taking a first stab on outlining some bullet points, based on the huddle recap convo we had just now after Wintermute call.
• Clarity around DOWG purpose and key initiatives: <@U03PZSSETQA> 
    ◦ We should do another pass of DOWG Charter to tie in the bigger picture thats consistent with the new pitch to OF providers.
    ◦ We should provide more clarity to MEV-share, FFMP, to DAWG, structurally.
    ◦ We should outline who are the first batch of participants outside of large builders, e.g. Jane Street instead of Jump.
• Playbook in strategic partnerhship building process: <@U03TG3UMZFD> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U04QCPQ0CG5> 
    ◦ Tactical triage: How many calls to have, in what order of operations, who goes on 1st call (usually big group call full of chaos on both sides), align on our pitch and ask, division of labor on our side, align on tactics
    ◦ Routines: Pre-call prep notes, meeting notes, post-call huddle recaps for constant iterations on the partnership pitches, follow up material from product, and from investments get sent across async, make sure all notes go into the new CRM.

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/04/2023 17:04:21 Z:
|   Definitely have some comments structurally around the dowg charter , but there's also the question of our asks/cta around mev-share repo (API standard + ffmp feedback) and relationship to dowg.
|   I personally think we can share the dowg charter by EOD today and it would be completely fine, but we want to align on key messages and clarity on obvious questions to prevent headaches...

|   separately, <@U03G0PNEV0E> i got their thoughts on hoc, contextualized w cancellations, free options, and decentralizing rfqs. they also really liked it, but said right now they can get pretty good latency (“incorporate all information and reduce enough uncertainty”) by running a builder. in other words, running a builder allows them to operate in mev-time.

|   I agree! that’s the big part for searcher builders, because they get better strategic certainty. As an information/latency player they naturally like the current game a lot. But the goal is to make them  lose money by running HOC and stuff to make sure a big chunk of their pie is gone

My very rough draft for the MEV-share builder message (tentatively to be first sent to Wintermute, SCP, Builder69) <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U04QCPQ0CG5>

Hey, we enjoyed our conversation the other day! I wanted to follow up on a few things that we discussed. Let us know if there are any questions!
1. As part of our current beta release of MEV-share implementation, we would like to start sharing with you orderflow from Flashbots, upon you agreeing upon *Fair Market Principles (FMP).* 
    a. Please review the FMP draft by EOD today. This FMP will be published in a public repo for our Decentralized Orderflow Working Group (DOWG): <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X4GBT_ihTGCm2MzDP9_ej4Cc2t0ZvLg3NNkXvb0aqW4/edit?usp=sharing>
    b. In practice, we will ask builders to submitting a PR to add your builder's name and RPC to the json file for builder registration, to attest to your agreeing to the FMP outlined in the DOWG repo.
    c. Builders will need to accept bundles in the format specified by `specs/mev_sendBundle`. For an example of how to integrate this new bundle format (and in particular how to enforce validity conditions), you can reference the open-source <https://github.com/flashbots/builder|Flashbots MEV-Boost Block Builder>. *[Insert docs link]*
    d. We will start sharing orderflow upon completion of the above registration.
2. Joining Decentralized Orderflow Working Group (DOWG)
    a. Charter drafting: this is our latest draft of the Charter, please review and provide your comments, would would love to iterate this with you. *[Insert draft link]*
    b. MEV-share is one of the primary activities for the DOWG. We just open-sourced the MEV-share repo for our community to collaborate on the technical specifications for the MEV-share protocol. It is intended to host discussion, development, and release notes for the protocol. Please take a look, would love to hear your input - just open an issue or create a PR!

|   As part of our beta release of MEV-share, we’d like to start sharing orderflow with you. Builders will need to agree with the *Fair Market Principles (FMP)* to receive orderflow: <https://github.com/flashbots/dowg/blob/main/fair-market-principles.md>. If you have an edit that needs to be made to the principles in advance of accepting them, please raise an issue on the repo

|   FYI, MEV-share uses a new bundle format called mev_sendBundle. For an example of how to integrate this new bundle format (and in particular how to enforce validity conditions), you can reference the open-source <https://github.com/flashbots/builder|Flashbots MEV-Boost Block Builder>

We recognize that this will take some time to integrate. In the short term, we’re happy to map these requests to a format that’s more similar to eth_sendBundle + refundPercent/Recipient — let us know if you have specific requests
|   In terms of timeline — We deployed the Matchmaker to mainnet today (public announcement coming tomorrow). PSA our team goes on an offsite next week, so if you have feedback or support Qs for the integration it would be great if we can address those by EOW

Hi! Wanted to follow up on the working group and MEV-share. We’re finishing up the first draft of the charter for the working group now, will share that here in a bit.

We’re also releasing an implementation of MEV-share right now, and would like to share orderflow with you as part of this. Would you be interested in that?

FYSA -- I've been playing around with the idea of a _Schoolhouse Rock I'm just a Bill_ knock off for a <https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ayg5RnA1Ty-Y-fzNUiG9S-_iA1N8f3xJ9_3-HrmLBQ/edit|Transaction> through the MEV supply chain. For those that are not aware of the lore behind the 1970's American educational classic of how a bill becomes a law, you can watch it here. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6MinvU93kI>

Earlier this week Jill from Espresso <https://twitter.com/jillrgunter/status/1652727544507154433?s=20|tweeted> nearly the same idea and I reachedout to her. We are going to have a chat this week about collaborating on making the video. Current thinking is that this is not some public collaboration between Flashbots and Espresso but instead just pulling resources to make the video and then releasing it in a grassroots style, no branding or affiliation on the video.

Reachout if you have any comments or concerns.

WIP:

I'm just a slot.
Yes, I'm only a slot.
And I'm sitting here waiting for some bots.
Well, it's a long, long journey
To build a block.
It's a long, long wait
While I'm pending confirmations,
But I know I'll be a block some day
At least I hope and pray that I will
But today I am still just a slot.
Waiting on some bots.

<@U03GRQX5HGR> Circling back on a few MEV-Share adoption tasks.

*Can you reach out to IMToken?*
1. Invite them to join DOWG
2. Sell them on sending their orderflow through MEV-Share (by using the Protect RPC)
Here are a few example blurbs to use as inspiration (though IIRC we need to talk with them in mandarin) <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Outreach-blurbs-09a8e61081964901987a615fcd7e6e6d?pvs=4|https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Outreach-blurbs-09a8e61081964901987a615fcd7e6e6d?pvs=4>

*Can you schedule a conversation with Ultrasound?*

I’d like to share the DOWG info with them in a quick call or in person sync. Ideally this week or early next. I know we got a soft yes but would like to formalize.

*Do you want to reach out to Rainbow?*
• Do you have a particular person in mind?
• Would it be valuable for you to personally run this convo?
• If not, I’ll have someone else reach out in a shared channel.
Ty! :purple_heart: 
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 03/05/2023 11:26:06 Z:
|   I can cover ultrasound intro - happy to intro to rainbow too if appropriate 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 03/05/2023 11:31:20 Z:
|   If someone has a strong personal connection to rainbow I imagine that would speed things up. Do you have a warm intro that’s better than our shared channel?
|   Tina already DM’d with ultrasound and they reacted with a vague thumbs up, so they know about this, but we haven’t properly sat down and talked about it.

So what would be particularly helpful is actually making a convo happen
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 03/05/2023 11:38:47 Z:
|   fwiw -- I ran into Alex from ultrasound last night and he mentioned dowg (not in name "and you guys are doing something on orderflow right?")
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 03/05/2023 11:39:10 Z:

|   And cool. Do we know who would need to sign off for rainbow to join DOWG? Is this the right person / can they connect us to them
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 03/05/2023 12:10:11 Z:

For context, there are currently three wallets in DOWG (coinbase wallet, phantom, and taho). We also plan to ask:

• Fireblocks

|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 03/05/2023 14:48:22 Z:
|   Less than MM, more than rainbow. Every Brave browser users has an active wallet and BAT tokens go to the brave wallet from ad engagement. They would also like to integrate Protect.

*Seeking input: How to get Metamask on board with joining DOWG?*

<@U04QCPQ0CG5> suggested that metamask will respond best to someone they view as senior. I propose we have someone in the steward set initiate the outreach to someone influential like Taylor. We pitch them on a high level, emphasizing MEV-Share as a tool that wallets can leverage to own their MEV and create new business and marketing strategies.

Once we get high level buy-in, we can ask them to point us to the people who should be included in day to day operations of the group (like being on calls). <@U03G59ZN90D> suggested that Gal is the relevant decision maker here.

Questions
• Who is the right person to initiate the high level outreach? <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03GRQX5HGR> 
• Should we include Coinbase Viktor in the first pitch?
I’d like to make moves on this (have the first call) *next week*.
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 05/05/2023 08:58:20 Z:
|   I can reach out to Taylor, we have a good relationship and we’ve talked a few times before. Indifferent on Viktor!
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 05/05/2023 09:03:29 Z:
|   I can aim for a call next week for sure 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 05/05/2023 09:06:18 Z:
|   Amazing
|   Viktor has a solid pitch, though I’m not sure if it might come across better from you (idk if taylor knows viktor)
|   I can help prep pitch if you wanna give it, or you can do the setup and hand it over to us to go into some details
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 05/05/2023 09:13:02 Z:
|   Off the top of my head here’s how the pitch tends to go
• Lots of different OFAs out there, hard for wallets to evaluate and nobody is making moves because it’s confusing what the guarantees are and what designs actually work
• We are taking a protocol first (not product first) approach
• It’s supposed to contain the minimal set of things everyone can agree on and be the most airtight design so wallets don’t have to worry about stuff like security
• What we ask of you: You declare the intention but not obligation to use it. Other than that it’s what you make of it, you can be as engaged as you like.
• TL;DR It’s a no brainer, this makes everyone’s life easy, doesn’t lock you in, and lots of others have already joined / we expect great participation
• For wallets: We’re keen to get your expertise— you’re the expert in the room when it comes to users and can shape the UX and impact the protocol to serve your needs
• This group will also be driving important developments in decentralizing the rest if the mev supply chain and is a good idea to be aligned with for vibes

What is the right medium of communication for the working group?

My goal is that we can consolidate a lot of the conversation in one public space (currently would suggest github). But people prob want a way to message the group and we’ll need a way to coordinate calls, etc

Options seem to be
• Telegram chat
• Discord channel
• Email list
• Slack channel
What is the optimal setup? Cc <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U03QCGC3SL9> <@U03TD87PTMK>

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 11/05/2023 00:08:57 Z:
|   I think email group is the best for calls coordination + forum posts + github. The same set of people competing with each other in the same private messaging  group chat does not make much sense at this stage.

> Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 11/05/2023 00:10:14 Z:

<@U03PZSSETQA> please let's take it a bit slower on the DOWG FMP. We are having more analysis on the regulatory front - would be prudent to give it a bit more review before finalizing, after <@U03GKHM4G9Z> is back from DC lawyer summit. This may be strategic.

|   Acknowledged. I would note that this is opt-in for users and it should be at least equivalent to, if not a strict improvement over, the status quo
|   We’re essentially adding more guardrails to how users and searchers already share their orderflow with builders

Update on Metamask/Consensys:
I caught up with my friend who is Global Head of Business Development at Consensys on our partnership - known her for years and each time we catch up had been deeply insightful. Here are the takeaways:
• Consensys strategy and partnership social graph
    ◦ Business Development (Shuyao leads 10 people team) focus on clear and direct integration on product fronts, focus on key account management
    ◦ Corporate Development (Ray leads 3 people team) focus on Consensys outbound investment + M&A, focus on potential synergistic or promising strategic exploration.
    ◦ Simon Brown as the most relevant and effective researcher helps BD and CD to navigate uncertain terrains, such as MEV space.
    ◦ For Flashbots partnership Simon + Ray are the key people (they have a boss Dave who leads strategy but Simon + Ray are the most important internal advocates for us).
• Metamask collab
    ◦ Taylor is not effective in Metamask team, power usually lies in the PMs, BDs will work with the PMs for integrations. Usually BDs handles external partnership with product teams, but there are leads from product teams to BD+CD teams as well, here is an example:
        ▪︎ Insights on Blockaid/Metamask collab: security was a big priority for Consensys in 2023, BD + research was working with the PMs on a thorough lay of the land industry analysis of security service providers, design trade-offs. Blockaid knew a PM in Consensys and made it into the analysis. Blockaid succeeded in POC and Corp Dev may be looking at a deal with Blockaid
    ◦ Insights: highly unlikely strategically Metamask will send flow to any other RPC than Infura.
    ◦ Best way to collab with Metamask: 
        ▪︎ work with Simon Brown, he is tasked with MEV research, too big of a topic for the team to prioritize, too unclear at this stage for BD team to get involved. 
        ▪︎ follow up with Ray on strategic investment.
• Competitors: Consensys had been pitched Vlad’s validator MEV pool concept with GPU mining, my friend asked for my comments - I pointed them to verify whether it’s concept or substance… <@U03FP0H62HH>
Here are my next steps on Metamask:
• Follow up with Simon + Ray in fundraising channel on strategic investments, DOWG TODAY <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03TG3UMZFD>
• Schedule a call with Simon + Metamask + <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> ASAP (cc. <@U04QCPQ0CG5> )
• FYI Simon Brown will be in NYC in June, for IC3 bootcamp ( <@U03UY83AGUQ> <@U03HT20PJES>) , good timing for closing the deal with Consensys/Metamask

|   i will follow up on this thread and coordinate a call this/next week. <@U03PZSSETQA> you would want to be on this call with Consensys right? (I know you are OOO Wed-Fri)
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 16/05/2023 14:26:16 Z:

|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 17/05/2023 21:35:04 Z:
|   I heard the deal is almost closed, but could also be a player in the orderflow stack instead of straight up OFA. I will try to learn more tomorrow
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 18/05/2023 09:25:56 Z:
|   this is big & somewhat shocking. if they acquire an OFA player, they will almost certainly use that exclusively and not mev-share
|   see Infura 
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/05/2023 09:44:00 Z:
|   My view on the metagame is: mev-share experiment with a credible path to programmable privacy in SUAVE is the most competitive design from a regulatory defensibility pov, can be the gold standard of consumer protection and market fairness. 

Given the heightened attention surrounding market making in the US reg environment and OFA are most certainly in the most regulated domain, and most legit  orderflow providers in bear market see MEV as a source for user engagement, they should be incentivized to choose MEV-share design or aim for "MEV-share compatibility". Even if with an acquisition they can at least converge onto a path. 

This goes into: do we / suave / programmable privacy ux benefit from mev-share compatibility?

|   Hey <@U03GRQX5HGR> it looks like our friends at Blockaid just put me and Viktor in touch with some folks from Metamask. I was added to a telegram group with Simon Brown and Didier Le Floch — they’re scheduling a call with us to discuss joining DOWG this week.

Wanted to make sure this was shared since I know we’re also coordinating our own conversations with Metamask (and Simon specifically).

Do you think it would cause issues for us to take the DOWG call separately?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 22/05/2023 19:23:44 Z:
|   separate in this case, however please make sure all DOWG calls are coordinated with <@U04QCPQ0CG5> and I.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 22/05/2023 19:25:59 Z:
|   I would like to ensure DOWG at this stage is being moved forward with <@U04QCPQ0CG5> inline with the MEV-Share adoption plan v2 as the canonical plan :pray:
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 22/05/2023 19:29:39 Z:
|   I’ll make sure you’re both added to the call. Do you want to be in the TG group as well?

The first is during the all hands — is the second time too late for European folks? cc <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U04QCPQ0CG5>

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 23/05/2023 16:18:59 Z:
|   Thursday would work, but it overlaps with all-hands, right? (Would be fine with me)
Friday I can't, too late. I'm traveling to Lido offsite Friday evening
|   Oh, since it's just the DOWG, I don't need to be there necessarily. Informed is enough

<@U03PZSSETQA>  an individual from RSK Labs reached out and would like to have a call to explore ways they can use MEV-Share & Protect for their tradfi-customers. Full context below:
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 17/05/2023 08:48:17 Z:
|   Unrelated to the actual inquiry… RSK Labs is the name of the Rootstock entity that’s been building smart contracts on Bitcoin forever. 

It does raise a small flag for this stealth co using a similar well known industry name for this co. 
|   
|   > Fred [U03TD87PTMK] @ 17/05/2023 09:09:06 Z:
|   Ya, my impression is that they are starting a new stealth project. Could be wrong, it's not very clear from the message.

|   Seems safe to ignore. They basically want us to do free education

> Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 17/05/2023 21:14:24 Z:
I had a good chat with Uma after being impressed by her presentation at DBA's research day on why intents are important and how they relate to account abstraction/suave. tl;dr: she is super aligned on the high level vision of intent/execution separation and on using evm to program user intents.

Succinct, her startup, has a pretty interesting oracle solution that could provide data to SUAVE. Users would write custom jobs in solidity for the data they want to be provided to other chains. She wants to align with us on how to best do that and to use SUAVE like code if we can.  I shared with her the bid contracts we made and we might collaborate on a blog post around intents vs account abstraction.

Relaying for visibility: potential ecosystem partnership with Eden
Eden Network (yes the one tried to vampire attack us in 2021 but got Greeden-geth'd) had reached out to us multiple times expressing apologies and desire to collaborate. They are interested in investing in our Series B as well. So we hopped on a call with them and explored how we may be able to collaborate. They have an active MEV search division. They operate on Avalanche a LSD protocol and active on Solana. Here are ways in which we may collab:
• Immediate Term Collaborative Opportunities (0-3 months):
    ◦ MEVShare: Flashbots indicated they have a short term want for Eden to join MEVShare as a searcher. <@U03PZSSETQA> 
        ▪︎ Next Steps: Eden (Caleb) to take a look at the data and opportunity, scope the work and feedback here.
    ◦ Sharing Chain Insights: Both parties agreed it would be mutually beneficial to have a more transparent relationship and share insights on different chain mechanics where the other party has unique data/insight. 
        ▪︎ Next Steps: Teams to decide on the optimal format/interface to optimize this sharing process + Eden (James) in the interim to look through our current internal research resources for anything relevant to share (bear with me as I am away from Friday for 14 days and have been banned from the computer :smile: ).
    ◦ Events/Presentations - Flashbots mentioned that if the above was valuable they would be interested in Eden presenting at their events. <@U04QCPQ0CG5> 
• Medium Term Collaborative Opportunities (3-6 months):
    ◦ Franchising: Flashbots mentioned the idea of franchising their brand/product to other chains (Optimism, Arbitrum etc). Eden feels they are uniquely positioned to add value and deliver this - this product is something we are already being asked to deliver (but not currently pursuing). 
        ▪︎ Next Steps: Flashbots to share details when/if they opt to pursue this idea.
    ◦ Financial/Investment Opportunities (Separate Workstream): SUAVE: Flashbots indicated they are doing an Ecosystem round and there is the potential for Eden to participate.
        ▪︎ Next Steps: Flashbots still finalizing the details on the ecosystem round. Flashbots to update Eden once this is finalized.

*Ecosystem conversation readout*: Capsule
• My friend Aditi works at Capsule
• Capsule provides a new way of executing transactions where the user has an "intent" that they permission an external application to be able to execute, e.g. a user permissions Lens to execute something on their behalf
• They're early in the process. 12 beta customers. Trying to fit in the area between "on and off chain" in their lens.
• Providing a set of developer SDKs for apps to integrate
• Could be a potential user of mev-share in the future, pretty early now tho

> Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 19/05/2023 17:24:26 Z:
*Ecosystem conversation readout*: Entropy
• disclosure: I angel invested in Entropy
• Entropy is trying to decentralize and democratize "Coinbase Custody" or Fireblocks for anyone
• One way to see Entropy is that it is a network that provides 1 part of a 2/2 multisig, with the user being the other part. 
• They allow users to program arbitrary rules for when and how their transactions would be executed (e.g. require 2fa before signing a tx)
• So for any transaction to be created the Entropy network must come to consensus that the user's rules were met
• They're super excited by the idea of intents and think it's obviously a huge increase in UX over regular txs
• They think their infrastructure is good for verifying and coming to consensus on arbitrary conditions
• They think this easily allows for intent expression and are thinking of offering this as a product in the future
• They're early in understanding MEV and how to handle it as a platform, only having the idea of trusting some party for the optimal execution of an intent
• They are interested in collabing in the future

> Brock [U03G5TMH05D] @ 19/05/2023 19:33:24 Z:
Any interest in this? They want to collaborate on best MEV practices, but I think what that really means is that they want us to tell them how to build their protocol. Could be valuable, idk.

Catching up with Chainlink co-founder Steve and Dan Moroz these few days at zuzalu, they definitely were amazed by the sealed bid auction and fascinated by the back stories of our mechanism design irl they see as very flashbots.
Plan to get to concrete next steps securing Chainlink investment and SUAVE-Chainlink collab. Do we have some clear questions around oracles in SUAVE design? Can some one link me the latest versions of research questions for SUAVE? <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA>
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 21/05/2023 06:48:38 Z:
|   For chainlink I think the biggest currently is the idea of providing mev-time oracles trustlessly. There’s room for manipulation if done naïvely, but there may be TEE/cryptography related things you can do (maybe using TLS or something) on top of cryptoeconomic things they’ve thought of before (and also threshold l-honesty stuff with median oracles maybe)

<@U03GRQX5HGR> where is your head at w.r.t to mev-boost ecosystem strategy these days? Reading the relay funding telegram group it seems like momentum in the group is growing around some proposals, and they aren't exactly what we had in mind. As an example, Matt from Blocknative is proposing that in principle relays are funded relative to their validator adoption - and he implictly means a "relay only funding vehicle" instead of a mev-boost funding vehicle. I worry that if we aren't leading the conversation or at least contributing our ideas more actively we may lose our opportunity to shape the conversation.

I know you've got an insane amount of work on your plate at the moment. Maybe <@U03G3CSRBQR> can get some time with you to get high level ideas, document them in writing, and we can start advocating in the group for them / executing on them?

|   Charlie said the meeting is for aligning our perspective with Uniswap. After Montenegro we aligned Dan Robinson, they relayed some of our concerns with Hayden, and wanted to use this meeting to explain to them how we think the market should evolve towards. 
|   Based on their prior convo with Hayden, they sensed that it may have to do with their corporate structure and a lot of things hayden may not have full control and visibility into, so want to have a direct explaination to align both sides going forward.

Had a good call with Simon and Didier from Consensys about joining DOWG. They seem bought in :tada: A few notes
• Metamask are still skeptical on value prop of OFAs in the long term. Not fully bought into the idea — they wonder if in the long run, MEV could be diminished by better designs in DEXes. There’s also tension between improving their own swaps product vs submitting to an OFA.
• They like the protocol-first approach of DOWG. It removes the requirement to back a certain project and be a kingmaker, but still allows them to participate in the design space.
• They also appreciate our focus on decentralization.
• The more general, long term, broader vision resonated with them. Didier was particularly glad that we focus not only on MEV-Share but also more broadly on designing new, permissionless mechanisms for OF Sharing.
• <@U03GRQX5HGR> made a great case for the regulatory / policy angle — Simon was very responsive to this, said it anticipated some of the concerns he had, seemed interested to talk more about what the framing should be (does DOWG become a self governing body, stay more free form, etc)
• Simon is going to search for the right people to join internally and it seems likely that they would officially say yes to joining after reading through the charter. Hope to hear from them next week!

I had a conversation with Uniswap (Hayden) along with <@U03GKHM4G9Z> and Dan Robinson. tl;dr:
• spent time talking high level about the importance of decentralization
• spent time talking about the nuances of their design
• spent time talking about the need for high level alignment and public commitments to decentralization
• spent a bit of time on mev-share and the matchmaker
note: I am calling Uniswap's RFQ + fee escalator by their codename for it, which is "Gouda"

some interesting tidbits:
• Hayden expressed a surprising interesting changing the design of Gouda given our feedback, he suggested he was open to changing so marketmakers submit txs instead of giving them exclusive filling rights for a period of time
• They are clearly interested in building as a way of having better guarantees around tx inclusion
• Hayden expressed interest in DOWG
• Hayden expressed interest in collaborating on MEV-Share and fitting their designs into it
• Hayden expressed interest in talking more to our research team
• Uniswap's wallet is head of Coinbase Wallet and Rainbow in terms of adoption
• Custom RPCs are the top requested feature for their wallet.
In the end Hayden told me he would follow up with me on the best interfaces for us internally and we set July (Paradigm is in town) as a potential in person touchpoint.

<@U03PZSSETQA> I don't think it's a good idea to add Viktor to the imtoken call, it's weird for a wallet partnership with good personal relationship to have a third party there unless they add credibility. The call was set up to talk about mev-share and DOWG as an intro, it's their PMs on the call. 

Flashbots is the gold standard for imtoken, as with most projects in the space, anyone else distract from such legitimacy. 

Imtoken just dm'd me to ask why is Viktor there and what's our expectations (I was not aware you were adding Viktor to most of these calls - indeed feels very strange to be on such a call if Viktor is on and the relationship is from our side - we don't need to "BD" like this. And even if we want to involve Viktor - only in cases, where he is the relationship owner or in 2nd or follow up calls, not first)

Cc. <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U02CJ9QVAL9>
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 30/05/2023 12:36:31 Z:
|   So, my impression was that this was an intro call to invite them to DOWG. I think it totally makes sense for Viktor to be involved in those — he has been leading several and is familiar with the pitch.

FWIW viktor’s also asked to be looped in more closely to our internal strategy around MEV-Share
|   It seems like maybe there was another agenda conveyed to IM token which I’m not aware of? But my intent is purely for us to invite them to the working group as part of our initial call. These are usually just a quick 30min sync btw
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 30/05/2023 13:10:06 Z:
|   We cannot talk about DOWG without giving context to MEV-Share, this is a wallet, they are not nearly connected to the west as Uniswap or others. Let’s please coodinate. I am creating a group with Viktor to make this clear. The DOWG group is a core part of the strategic development, please coordinate with <@U04QCPQ0CG5> and I.

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 30/05/2023 14:54:26 Z:
|   They can, imtoken is one of the most credible wallet in asia and a significant dex <@U05578MHMUZ> may have insights on their volume

> Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 30/05/2023 09:41:09 Z:
Based on our product strategy + reg research and partnership convos last week, DOWG and reg moat should be a strategic priority.
Based on Reid's Mev-share adoption plan v3, I suggest <@U04QCPQ0CG5> takes the lead on setting up the DOWG project, and pushing it forward. We start by updating the narrative around it, and setup workflow for the working group going forward. 

(Please note - this doesn't mean <@U03PZSSETQA> you won't directly chat or communicate with them. You should be able to fluidly chat with any partners as you wish, but we work as a team, has  lear roles and responsibility, and execute a canonical adoption plan.)

Specifically, we agree the strategy for this project together, the relationship follows the same playbook in how we communicate DOWG and mev-share, we agree on the updates in the charter. (The current draft of the charter, as I said before, is too mev-share specific. It's in the uncanny valley between a product promotion group (the opposite of what we want) and an under defined sro.)

We also agree on a routine and align expectations for the calls and external comms with partners - at what stage how do we communicate what key message.

Hopefully this reduces the confusion as we develop our partnership.

Julio from Circles UBI wrote to me interested to discuss about SUAVE solvers. They are working on a cool credit network with anonymous trust: <https://hackmd.io/@ajinkya/H1Zujczr3|https://hackmd.io/@ajinkya/H1Zujczr3>
He is in Vienna so I put him in contact with our team there :)
<@U03GALFRWRG> would you like to be added? I think you are the one who can answer his questions. <@U055KQHH3FZ> I'll pull you in too :smiley:
Anybody else interested?
Circles is a side project from gnosis Martin, I think this is a place where we can connect with a whole different perspective, and that can make the other relation lighter.
<@U03G0PNEV0E> this might be the suave use case that doesn't involve any murder marketplace.

<http://dexview.com|dexview.com> reached out about integrating Protect. They asked about an increased rate limit from 80 requests per second. This is maybe the 3rd project that has specifically asked for this feature, that I am aware of. Are there simple answers for this?
1. Is this possible and easy to accomplish
2. What do we need from them to accomplish?
3. What is our own internal time commitment here and how long will it take?

|   Please direct such protect / rate limiting requests to me + <@U03G9SDPA1J>; the rate limits are implemented in AWS WAF. Yes there's ways to lift them, the easiest being setting different rate limits for a given IP of them.

Can you please open a TG or other group chat with them?

Should we add more OFAs to DOWG? What about our friends at Rook
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 01/06/2023 10:29:11 Z:
|   On rook specifically:

One benefit of adding them would be that I think they might get behind a push (diff from vlad’s) to propose changes to PBS so might be nice to have some more alignment. 

I think their current conception of their auction is that in equilibrium it will be builders bidding for OF so they may not care about FMP etc. the other side of that is that they may want to enforce other kinds of behaviour/make their auction more accessible to searchers so I could be wrong
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 01/06/2023 14:24:23 Z:
|   Do you think their design could be reconciled with MEV-Share?
|   Like could we align on common APIs that are general enough to work for both
|   I suspect we could get there for MEVBlocker but don’t know very much about the rook design. If they’re totally different it’s a bit trickier to push the “unification” narrative/agenda
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 02/06/2023 08:19:31 Z:
|   Yeah I’m not sure what they could want from DOWG in terms of enforcing bidder behaviour
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 02/06/2023 20:39:08 Z:
|   Do you think their design is fundamentally non-reconcilable with MEV-Share?
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 02/06/2023 21:58:11 Z:
|   Not sure what reconcilable would mean here? You could bid on something in the rook auction and then submit via mevshare but seems suboptimal
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 02/06/2023 22:03:51 Z:
|   Ah I mean like could Rook’s design be built on the same APIs as MEV-Share
|   Ie does our protocol generalize to support their auction/product
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 03/06/2023 00:30:30 Z:

Clayton at figment reached out in my dms asking how they can support Suave as a validator. I told him I thought the timeline on something like that was a few quarters or more away, but I needed to check internally. Is there something we can leverage with Figment here?

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 05/06/2023 14:14:34 Z:
|   We don’t have an immediate need for them as a validator. Could become relevant further down the line, maybe <@U02CJ9QVAL9> has thoughts on specific timelines but I wouldn’t expect for another few Qs at least

As an asset manager they’re connected to a lot of sources of orderflow (wallets, custodians, etc) so could be interesting from that POV. Maybe more from a BD angle? Don’t understand their product enough to know if a deeper integration would work here :thinking_face:

Flagging I'm catching up with <https://twitter.com/hhua_?t=mC8bFub9LQXRqQP__hhGQg&s=09|Han> from Google Ventures, he was a former mev searcher from 2017. I met him at ethdenver, shared with him <http://cryptoxai.wtf|cryptoxai.wtf> and <http://crediblecommitments.wtf|crediblecommitments.wtf> material. He is based on Sf - suggest <@U03G0PNEV0E> meet up with him. (If you can - should also ask if GV wanna be part of our ecosystem round - we are wrapping up this month.

A connection who now does BD for BNB chain reached out about a Flashbots/BNB chat. Scheduled a time with him for Tuesday next week (8:30am EST). I'll plan to take the call and share back their interest. Feel free to ping with anything I should be thinking about (franchise and l2 expansion top of mind). Also happy to include anyone if they want to join this initial chat.

Coin98 MEV-Share Intro call:

tldr:
• Coin98 has over 6 million users - 25% in Vietnam, the rest distributed in Asia, Russia, Africa. 
• Coin98 aims to be the multichain super app where users can explore Defi on every L1 and L2. They have integrated nearly every major and minor chains plus L2s. 
• They have not thought about OFAs or MEV sharing. 
• They are interested in testing and integrating MEV-Share
• They are interested in participating in the Ecosystem Alignment round from their Ventures side
Questions they asked:
• how easy is it to integrate
• do you have a test environment our devs can use to test it
• how do you make money on it, is there a cost for us
• what does using the flashbots protect RPC mean for their current RPC providers? Could they have non-mev likely txs go through their preferred RPC rather than infura? 
Next Steps:
• share technical docs in telegram group
• send details on ecosystem alignment round

That could be a pretty good feature to add. I could imagine a case where the user also has a preference here. Seems straightforward to implement? <@U04QCPQ0CG5> can you add this to our <https://www.notion.so/EM-Team-Feature-Requests-9b4a3f210e47429b85ae4ed374c387ea|EM feature requests> (see “orderflow provider UX”)

> do you have a test environment our devs can use to test it
We run an instance of MEV-Share on goerli. It would be interesting to get them to try it and to see what feedback they have. One thing to call out is that we have basically no searching activity on goerli — We might want to deploy one of our bots there so they at least can understand what kickbacks would look like. I think this shouldn’t be as much of an issue as running a bot on mainnet? cc <@U02CJ9QVAL9>

> Coin98 has over 6 million users
In addition to users, one thing that would be quite valuable to know is the *number of transactions* they send daily. This would give us a sense of comparison to Protect (how much will this partner increase our orderflow by?). Also I wonder if they have any sense for the *MEV-value* of their orderflow (eg. is there high value DEX trades in there?)
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 15/06/2023 14:47:57 Z:
|   1/ yes I can!

2/ best info to pass along about the goleri testing for them?

3/ agreed, will add it to the questions.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 15/06/2023 23:50:16 Z:
|   They should send their orderflow to <https://rpc-goerli.flashbots.net>
|   And then the dapp/wallet onboarding guide should have more details <https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-share/orderflow-providers/integration-guide>
|   TL;DR <@U04QCPQ0CG5> tell them to *follow the <https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-share/orderflow-providers/integration-guide|guide> but replace <http://rpc.flashbots.net|rpc.flashbots.net> with <http://rpc-goerli.flashbots.net|rpc-goerli.flashbots.net>*

Hart Lambur (founder of UMA) is coming to the NYC duck at 5pm today to whiteboard. 
• He is a good friend and an expert in market structure (former principal trader at Goldman, before building UMA protocol) as well as oracles and defi. Would have been an ideal market structure guy + operator to have on the team. 
• He is an investor in flashbots via Robot Ventures, would like to get a better understanding of suave, and help us think through working with oracles and market structure questions. 
• We can explore how to collaborate with him on research or oracle design problems.

Are we interested in the samczsun+Hudson “red team” event where a large attack is simulated and responded to ? 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 22/06/2023 20:45:38 Z:
|   Is this the same whitehat CTF that we discussed earlier? Not sure where the thread is but I thought the conclusion was that it wouldn’t jive well with mev-share. Perhaps we have another reason to do it though?
|   
|   > Scott Bigelow [U03H6U5F200] @ 23/06/2023 16:31:22 Z:
|   i think regardless of CTF, there is the question of if Flashbots wants to be involved with this event. it seems to me it will be well-publicized and good for the ecosystem. in spinning up a fork of mainnet to emulate a very large scale compromise. given that flashbots is a core component of ethereum, it be useful to have representation on that fork
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 23/06/2023 16:39:07 Z:
|   Makes sense. The main question to me would be how we balance priorities/resources/time. Given it isn’t directly related to the top line goals
|   Do you have a sense for how much time/work this would require on our end and who could be the owner (if not you)?
|   
|   > Scott Bigelow [U03H6U5F200] @ 23/06/2023 17:00:39 Z:
|   it's difficult to quantify importance. there is a security/white hat element to it, and general goodwill/marketing . protecting user funds, etc
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 23/06/2023 18:49:12 Z:
|   If it’s like a day of work I think it’s a reasonable investment. If it’s something that’s going to be a lot more involved then might be more of a discussion. Wdyt?
|   
|   > Scott Bigelow [U03H6U5F200] @ 26/06/2023 15:16:35 Z:
|   I don't know how long anything takes any more. i thought CTF would be like 1d . do we need any legal stuff for this sort of an event?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 26/06/2023 15:34:29 Z:
|   Haha yeah these things tend to scope creep
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> do you have context on the amount of overhead that will be involved in this CTF? Can ask sam directly but you may already be read into this
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 26/06/2023 17:12:35 Z:
|   <@U03H6U5F200> I think I said this many weeks ago that legal is not the blocker for CTF (after the call <@U03H6U5F200> you were on)
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 26/06/2023 17:14:53 Z:
|   <@U03H6U5F200> how should we be involved in the red team event, without the searcher CTF? Can you describe it? And with our searcher  CTF?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 26/06/2023 17:19:12 Z:
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> to clarify:
1. My question is about paradigm’s red team event (I called this a CTF, might have been the wrong word). We wanted to know what overhead might be involved there — to scope how much work it would be for us to be involved
2. We didn’t see a good way to connect the red team event with mev-share/our CTF. So it would be an entirely separate effort.
3. There isn’t a legal blocker for our CTF — yes, we’re tracking this!
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 26/06/2023 17:22:51 Z:
|   TL;DR this would be an extra thing we do that isn’t really tied to mev-share, so trying to figure out the cost/benefit of investing in it
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 26/06/2023 17:23:05 Z:
|   Gotcha, I think if there's internal interest, and <@U03H6U5F200> believes it's worthwhile for us to be represented (Whitehat community is part of our roots), and that there's no foreseeable downside risk for our involvement, then it's just our branding, and scope out our eng resource ahead. 
Are there any other orgs contributing to it?
|   
|   > Scott Bigelow [U03H6U5F200] @ 26/06/2023 17:23:40 Z:
|   many
|   let me get the list
Sam asked me if flashbots wanted to be involved , set up relay on fork that is compromised , etc

Based on my experience, inviting this week is definitely not late but good timing, I would even go as far as saying this is pretty much the earliest we can go - ETHcc speaking slots just came out this past week (a lot of key people need to know this in order to commit to which days they are available), hence based on the known availability, we will pick the timeslots optimized for the key stakeholders we want there, smaller fish will naturally follow. 

We already know the most important ones and we are all in dms - they are aware of MEV week. We only floated the most recent TEE Party, Denver researchathon, both only on the day before, just like every one of the .wtf. 

Why? For side events, we wait for the strategic moment when there's enough information about other events content and speaking slots constraints in order to act, to maximize momentum and impact. 
Let's trust, take a deep breath, we got this ;)

|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 12/07/2023 16:18:38 Z:
|   This is what they want to do. In their current model they’d need some support from us to identify mev share txns / recipients <https://hackmd.io/@k05rNR4FS26flqCmZvAUXA/mev-share-oev|https://hackmd.io/@k05rNR4FS26flqCmZvAUXA/mev-share-oev>

It’s a somewhat complex design. I think it would require investment to properly understand, suggest adjustments, and then possibly add support for certain things

I knew some of their leadership before, and Bitmain’s antpool was mev-geth adoptor, im close to some of the customers/users were big chinese miners who happen to be top sandwichers as well, but havent touched based with them recently. 

Primarily im interested in: MatrixPort AUM, customer base, wallet orderflow, do they do staking, do they do MEV stuff. (Asking <@U05578MHMUZ> as well if you are familiar with them, anything high level is sufficient no need to dig further)

They use very centralized and custodial solutions. Can check with Web3Auth founder on their exact market share

:thread:*SUAVE Paris Thread on Key Partnership Meetings*
This week in Paris, since <@U02CJ9QVAL9> and many of our SUAVE / research engineering / product teams are here, we are planning on setting up some SUAVE deep dives (POC demo x whiteboarding) with key partners who can provide insights, critique and feedback on SUAVE architecture, and on potential points of collaboration. We primarily picked targets that are most likely to integrate with us, and have shown commitment through _Series B conversation_ + _PBS.day interviews_ (<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/PBS-day-Interviews-477619dc076441f0af848f8148580923|WIP notes> - h/t <@U03G59ZN90D>).
• *Prioritization for ecosystem partners' SUAVE deep dives (45min or 75min)*
_h/t <@U03FP0H62HH>for jamming, let me know if I am missing anyone can still slot them in. (cc. <@U02CJ9QVAL9>_ _<@U03PZSSETQA>_ _<@U03QCGC3SL9>)_
1. *Consensys / Metamask (Scheduled - Friday)* :white_check_mark:
2. *EF Researchers (Vitalik, Justin Drake, Mike Neuder, Alex Stokes):* came to PBS.salon, Justin is leaving Friday, we should aim to schedule on Thursday*.* :hourglass_flowing_sand:
3. *Aztek (Scheduling)* :hourglass_flowing_sand:
4. *Celestia (Scheduled Wednesday)* :white_check_mark:
5. *Scroll (Scheduling - Thursday)* :hourglass_flowing_sand:
6. *Chainlink (Scheduling)* :hourglass_flowing_sand: 
7. *Arbitrum (Scheduling)* :hourglass_flowing_sand:
• *Ecosystem partners we should get SUAVE feedback*
_Here are the ones would be good to get their feedback on SUAVE but can be flexible with format or channel to SUAVE.salon (can be but don't have to be 75min deep dives)_
1. *Base rollup by Coinbase:* Jesse Pollock (Base lead) and Nick Prince (Base PM) are both here in Paris, but given their main net launch in August, I have discussed with Nick Prince, they are keen to get help on decentralization, but may not have bandwidth to deeply dive into SUAVE architecture. Nick Prince will come to Orderflow.salon and Suave.salon to learn more.
2. *Uniswap (coming to <http://orderflow.sa|orderflow.sa>*lon, invited us to Uniswap dinner where Frontier is also invited, NY-based so don't have to deep dive this week in Paris)
3. *GSR (not yet scheduled, visiting MEV Pi-rate Ship on Wednesday - we really should invite them to come to orderflow.salon <@U04QCPQ0CG5>)*
4. *Wintermute (coming to orderflow.salon, registered for <http://suave.sa|suave.sa>*lon*)*
5. *SCP (coming to orderflow.salon, registered for <http://suave.sa|suave.sa>*lon*)*
6. *Polygon (not yet scheduled)*
7. *Fastlane (registered for <http://suave.sa|suave.sa>*lon, available Friday)
8. *Blocknative (registered for suave.salon)*
9. *Espresso (not yet scheduled)* 
10. *Astria (not yet scheduled)*
11. *UMA (not yet scheduled)*
*The focus of the technical deep dives are L2s and SUAPP appropriate partners. My prioritization is based on:* 
1. how aligned with SUAVE they are (indication of interest via skin in the game like investment)
2. how strongly they expressed willingness in building on SUAVE
3. how technically capable their team present in Paris is
4. how rare does <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03PZSSETQA> get to meet them (based outside of NY or US)
I will share *Meeting Prep Notes* on each scheduled 1:1s for our Paris mates and <@U02CJ9QVAL9> in this thread via replies.:point_down:

|   *Celestia Paris Jam Prep <@U02CJ9QVAL9>* *<@U03PZSSETQA>* *<@U05BMHJMRNK>* *<@U03G4UY5NN9>* *<@U03QCGC3SL9>* 
• *Goal:* Getting technical feedback on SUAVE design from the team architecting the Modular Stack, and share a non-maximalism world view, heavy emphasis on ecosystem collab (likely to dispatch some Celestia ecosystem team to build SUAVE POC if we figure out a way to collab, but I suspect it may be E20s unless we object). IMO their design is approaching that of Espresso's but coming from a DA pov, would be good to see how they think we fit in the modular stack and potential means of collab.
• *Who:* We are meeting with <https://twitter.com/NashQueue|Gabriel> (team lead at Rollkit), <https://twitter.com/evansforbes|Evan Forbes> (core dev focused on MEV, considered a 100x dev), <https://twitter.com/JacobArluck|Jacob Arluck> (strategy), <https://www.linkedin.com/in/callum-waters-4b78951a2/?originalSubdomain=de|Callum Waters> (Eng, former Eng Manager at Cosmos ICF)
• *Why now:* 
    ◦ Celestia expressed interest in investment in SUAVE in locked up tokens <@U03FP0H62HH> 
    ◦ Celestia is launching main net in September
    ◦ The ones we are meeting are generally familiar with SUAVE
    ◦ Thoughtful wrt MEV on modular stack
• *Things to read up about their ecosystem*
    ◦ Gabriel's latest <https://twitter.com/NashQueue/status/1680055369219932160?s=20|thread> + post on rollups
    ◦ Celestia is likely invested in E20s as one of MEV ecosystem partners (see <@U03HT20PJES>'s <https://blog.essential.builders/introducing-essential/|thread>)

|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 19/07/2023 08:56:11 Z:
|   Got it, it would be good if you can make sure your Google calendar up to date and reflects speaking responsibilities <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U05BMHJMRNK> (cc. <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U03TD87PTMK>)

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 19/07/2023 08:58:28 Z:
|   My thoughts
• great call to add *Base* -- had totally forgotten about them. They didn't come up in our convo w/ Coinbases Ventures, either. it's annoying that they treat us entirely as a financial investment and so far we haven't been able to escalate to a strategic parntership level. Let's prioritizethem IMO
• I would bump *Uniswap* to the higher priority tier. Right now is a good time to understand how SUAVE can help UniswapX.
• *Fastlane* -- <@U05BMHJMRNK> and I had a long call with Alex yesterday and we were both not impressed. I would channel his feedback to SUAVE.salon. No 1on1s.
• I wonder if we should prioritize *Cowswap* to give them a demo of SUAVE ahead of a call in the next 1-2 week. I think they are desperate and open to doing something on SUAVE if it allows them to pivot their business model
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 19/07/2023 08:59:58 Z:
|   Interesting! Cool let's prioritize Uniswap + Cowswap then? <@U02CJ9QVAL9> thoughts? Who should we have from cowswap/gnosis? Felix + Martin?
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 19/07/2023 09:04:47 Z:
|   Base sg to me, I know that Jesse is a fan. I can ask my friend who is an eng there about meeting. I was invited to come to their space later too.
|   CoWSwap also sg. Happy to do it.

Uniswap I think we can, but not sure I'd prioritize because we can also meet them next week.

|   Yes
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 19/07/2023 09:06:18 Z:
|   Yeah that's better
|   I assume Dan is not in Paris, right?
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 19/07/2023 09:06:34 Z:
|   Dunno
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 19/07/2023 09:06:53 Z:
|   having him in the room has certain value but if he's not in Paris anyway, which I suspect, then its def better to do it in a more private setting in NYC
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 19/07/2023 09:07:01 Z:
|   I don't think Dan Robinson is here but let me check
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U04QCPQ0CG5> who's coming from cowswap to our DOWG researchathon today? I don't see their name listed in the notion nor luma.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 19/07/2023 09:11:33 Z:
|   It would be really good if for each of these meetings someone from product can take notes. Let me know who to coordinate with on this  <@U02CJ9QVAL9>
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 19/07/2023 09:14:37 Z:
|   I reached out to Jesse to see if he's amenable / available to meeting
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03QCGC3SL9> would be the right person

|   <@U03QCGC3SL9> yes, you have already been added to all SUAVE deep dive sessions we scheduled since I started scheduling them (after <@U02CJ9QVAL9> landed). Right now Scroll, Aztek are tentative for Thursday, they are trying to find time in the morning. Will keep you all posted anyone confirms.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 19/07/2023 11:27:39 Z:
|   1. My calendar was updated and had a hold for the panel
2. I DM’d with felix — he said he would join from cow swap but hasn’t filled out the event page. I just reached out to confirm with him!

|   *Ecosystem partner meetings - Jul 20 (Thursday):*
• Starkware - 11:00am
• Scroll (Toghrul) - 12:15pm (he's checking in with rest of team to make sure he can make it)
• Aztec (Joe Andrews) - Thursday 10am or Friday (still scheduling). 
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 20/07/2023 01:02:00 Z:
|   Separately, the following two teams would love to check out our POC if possible.
• *Wintermute team* - they are heading out Thursday afternoon, would love to stop by and get a demo and drop off swags for us lol. -> I told them to coordinate with <@U02CJ9QVAL9> you directly, or we can ask <@U05BMHJMRNK> to do the demo.
• *Cowswap -* Felix is living 5min walking distance from pirate ship, he would love to pop in for a suave demo - I told him to coordinate directly with <@U02CJ9QVAL9> (alternatively we can ask <@U05BMHJMRNK> to jam with him. 
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 20/07/2023 06:48:12 Z:
|   If it works for WM great but let’s not push it. They are not gonna be an early partner for us. For sure prioritize cowswap. I’ll schedule 
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 20/07/2023 06:50:55 Z:
|   Agree, not much overlap w/ Wintermute. They even skipped our round. Let's deprioritize them
|   
|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 20/07/2023 06:56:35 Z:
|   <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03GRQX5HGR> - Scroll meeting is during my 1:1 with Chris, which I’ve already rescheduled a few times and want to prioritize. Will stay at house to take the call, maybe end early. Just fyi I won’t be at the beginning

:point_right:<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Celestia-5cb379d251a74255a42dd79ccae8339d| Notes from July 19 Celestia / Suave Meeting:>

*Important takeaways:*
• Celestia is excited to co-design Suave integration. :tada: 
• They envision Suave as “*a rollkit integrated with block-building and MEV extraction features.”* 
• _Alt narrative:_ *Suave as trusted shared sequencer. Celestia, a rollup to Suave, the trusted DA layer and block-builder*
• They have an interesting <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Celestia-5cb379d251a74255a42dd79ccae8339d?pvs=4#07415c4b97c84d6ba3ac351858ad1b99|fork choice rule narrative>, and illuminated several <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Celestia-5cb379d251a74255a42dd79ccae8339d?pvs=4#83b82b6af3bb4bd1ac3d1e44ab759326|technical considerations> for us to tackle, but it’s early in both of our launch + adoption cycles. Path to collaborate is primed.
*Next steps:* 
• More formal technical co-designing w/ Celestia in Q4’23 (September) once Flashbots shifts Suave on-boarding from Eth L1 + mev-infra => L2s and alt chains.
• Flashbots/Celestia establish regular meetings to discuss market signals Celestia encounters as they gear up to launch. These insights to inform Suave designs wrt VMs, rollups, and other FCR’s the market signals it wants.

:trophy: Hackathon sponsorships
1. *Aug 4-18 Ethglobal Superhack:* 
• Optimism is sponsoring a virtual ethglobal hackathon with Base, Worldcoin, etc. Called "Superhack" . Should L2 workstream Optimism PBS POC be a project to submit to the hackathon?
*2. Sep 22-25 ETHGlobal NY*
• Should Flashbots consider sponsoring the NY hackathon and fund teams to build suave on SUAVE?

|   <@U03TG3UMZFD> we have some presence in Korea, I know many major teams there, Cosmos devs, Ethereum devs, also CFO of Starknet Foundation is in Korea. I am connected with hackathon organizers, spoke at Klaytn meetups, did flashbots talks at 4 or 5 events there during BUIDL Asia this year. Visited DSRV, Xangle, Kroma, lambda256, Cosmostation in their offices.

|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 20/07/2023 13:37:52 Z:
|   I want to, a lot! the challenge IMO is how ready is SUAVE for hackathons?

|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 20/07/2023 13:38:14 Z:

|   
|   > Mateusz Morusiewicz [U03GALFRWRG] @ 20/07/2023 13:41:05 Z:
|   I think it’s early. The dev ux (apis and docs) are lacking.
On the other hand if we are not afraid of releasing something that’s rough we could open the suave codebase and have people play with it.

|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 03/08/2023 08:46:17 Z:
|   fwiw, we should try to participate in every hackathon.

Happy to help coordinate this -- looks likle we'd have to move pretty quickly. Apologies for the super late reply to assist ;(
|   
|   > Fred [U03TD87PTMK] @ 08/08/2023 12:38:38 Z:
|   We missed the boat on the Superhack, but going forward we should *define a strategy* for how we evaluate hackathons and decide which ones we want to sponsor, and which ones to pass.

Results from hackathons are very much hit-or-miss in my experience, and they are often quite expensive. So let's structure a set of criteria and prize range that can help us better evaluate, make decisions and follow up on hackathons we sponsor.

I've begun this work by mantaining the <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/93f1fff273a64807817107277dfec616?v=4bcf432f44d34926ae26d6ac38bab1b0|Upcoming events db> (which also includes Hackathons) and modifying the <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Evaluate-events-Uniswap-fork-0b82fdfa15c5434f9c41b0ca23c1959a|Uniswap event evaluation sheet> to help us built out this framework.

With the release of suave-geth this week, we will publish a set of <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C03FCJJ4UN7/p1691473803845729?thread_ts=1691412691.321699&cid=C03FCJJ4UN7|Open Architecture/Code Related Challenges> on the forum. I'm unsure if these are a good fit for a hackathon, but the concept can be expanded upon!

*Suave Integration Meeting Notes at EthCC,* a _thread_ :point_down: 
|   
|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 24/07/2023 21:37:10 Z:
|   *Starknet*
⇒ <https://www.notion.so/Starknet-f306be02ebac438abd8876e09854fde3?pvs=21|Detailed Notes Here>

*Key Takeaways:*
This discussion was unfortunately more of a fundamentals alignment call. The discussion began comparing consensus mechanisms on Starknet (Tendermint) versus Ethereum (e.g. slashing and random leader election, block time and transaction throughput) and ended with PBS fundamentals (role separation between block ordering from proposing, tx censorship after EIP 1559, the relay and builder market). Ultimately, we were unable to discuss Suave or consider outcomes of a Starknet / Suave integration.

*Next Steps:*
• Possibly setup another discussion to get into the specifics of PBS on Starknet. Likely a separate call would then be required to discuss the design of Suave, and another to discuss what an integration could mean.
• Given resource constraints, would consider collaboration less likely in 2023 due to limited shared knowledge. The educational process is likely to be resource-intensive for Flashbots. 
• Starknet was certainly not closed to further discussion.
|   *Scroll*
⇒ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Scroll-e61e7b9dc7ff45dbae0d75c3bd3644e5?pvs=4#9cc356d1c7124ee081d3c21237d80b42|Detailed Notes Here>

*Key Takeaways:*
_*Note*: I left early for this meeting, <@U02CJ9QVAL9> /<@U03GALFRWRG> please add any missed context!_
• Similar to other L2 teams, Scroll is reconsidering the roles of the sequencer and prover, and weighing the impact of external PBS vs ePBS on consensus, sequencer decentralization, censorship resistance, and finality guarantees.
• Discussion on Suave was well-understood. Questions focused on how Suave will achieve L1 &lt;&gt; L2 synchronization, user-submitted data confidentiality, censorship resistance, and MEVM consensus and transaction ordering.
• It was mentioned that Scroll has an SGX implementation of their EVM already.
*Next Steps:*
• Scroll seeking research support (from Flashbots?) to answer PBS consensus concerns.
• Technical next steps:
    ◦ Figure out API for Scroll to listen to Suave block proposals
    ◦ Scroll to run an Execution Node

|   *ConsenSys*
⇒ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/EthCC-Suave-Demo-27aa550a9fb745d39d892eb3be570ef1|Detailed Notes Here>

*Key Takeaways:*
• Top priorities for ConsenSys are sequencer decentralization and PBS / blockbuilding for their new zkEVM rollup product, <https://linea.build/|Linea>.
• They’re bullish about Suave as an encrypted data availability layer for Linea, and jammed on integrating UniX and Suave bids into Metamask.
• They expressed concern about enshrining centralized actors with an external PBS solution like Mev-Boost on Linea, and inquired how to get around that. Seemed interested to hear Suave positioned as a decentralized block builder and relay option that they could submit ordeflow to.  
*Next Steps:*
• Simon to sketch PoC architecture of Linea execution node, as well as builder solidity contracts for Linea / Metamask
• Team will also work on Metamask and Linea frontend tx integrations for UniX and Suave Bids

|   *CowSwap / Mev-Blocker*
⇒ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/CowSwap-0b454589677d4a4aa3adaf8faf19f225?pvs=4#9ad14b98597b44f597011c24d1b150a4|Detailed Notes Here>

*Key Takeaways:*
• Felix is quite bullish for “*CowSuave.”* Suave is what Cowswap has needed for a data availability and compute layer. He’s excited to get his hands on Suave sandbox in the next month.
• More skepticism was shared about Suave for Mev-Blocker and the builder market. The unique selling point of Mev-blocker is their “transaction sharing model” and building merging algorithm, *which Felix doesn’t want expose.*
• Felix believes IP sharing concerns will be echoed across the broader builder landscape.
• Still, he’s excited about the CowSwap use-case. We jammed on a number of i<https://www.notion.so/CowSwap-0b454589677d4a4aa3adaf8faf19f225?pvs=21|mportant open questions> including running TEEs, distributed system requirements, sharing data between execution nodes, PBS given an EN network, and others.
*Next Steps:*
• For CowSwap: Meet after quarterly planning in 3-4 weeks to confirm roadmap to decentralization. They are still determining how urgent decentralization is compared to cross-chain.
• For Mev-Blocker: Need to talk w/ Mev-blocker team about how to write sharing model and merging algo to builder solidity. Beyond that, need to gather requirements from solvers (mev-blocker users). Likely want to see a more concrete way they can protect novel building approaches, algorithms, and other “USP” from exposure.
• In advance of that, let’s workshop on concrete precompiles needed for mev-blocker, cowswap, idea for “orderflow PEPC,” idea for “<https://www.notion.so/CowSwap-0b454589677d4a4aa3adaf8faf19f225?pvs=21|monkey sort builder>.”

|   *Aztec*
⇒ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Aztec-88106e4ba6714da08598e86c0655cb05|Detailed Notes Here>

*Key Takeaways:*
• Joe is committed to decentralization and minimizing censorship / regulatory risks. If Suave is not launched decentralized out of the box, it’s a non-starter for Aztec.
• More Importantly, Flashbots may want to reconsider prioritizing TEE implementation for Suave Centauri launch to shield us from regulatory risks. E.g.) We won’t control what type of orderflow is sent to confidential data stores or what type of state will be run in Suave ENs.
• We can either launch with TEE ready or phase an Aztec integration to Suave Phase 2: Andromeda.
*Next steps:*
• Talk about potential Suave / Aztec blockbuilding solution mid-Q3, late August, after Foundry / Aztec smart contract sandbox launch.
• There are a number of <https://www.notion.so/Aztec-88106e4ba6714da08598e86c0655cb05?pvs=21|technical roadblocks> for Aztec to tackle before an integration, including handling upgrades, and sequencer decentralization.

should have a committee internally or allow some people to make unilateral decisions? I would suggest a committee of Tina, Shea, Reid.

where to track -- I would suggest all new interested parties should be added to the database and we can add a new column for pending member that is rectified once the commmitte makes a decision.

Getting to my to do item to reply to BNB's messages in that Telegram chat that was set up earlier this week:

Have any of you taken a look?

I assume we have no interest in "Flashbot as relayer for our BSC validators."

I wanted to ask if you all have had any other L2s approach MEV in the way they descirbed? "We view our role as more on increasing transparency on the solutions available in the ecosystem and it’s up to the validators to decide which/if any MEV solutions to implement."

I'm happy to reply if you all deem this a super low priority but would still need you input on the above.

Starting a thread to coordinate the adoption work with rest of the orgs <@U03PZSSETQA> .

*<https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C03FF05EXD2/p1691670841306059|Context:>* <@U03G59ZN90D> and I (with support from <@U03N9H4JP8C> <@U04QCPQ0CG5>) are working on *our 1st adoption strategy memo - orderflow acquisition strategy*, which will comprise of an orderflow market landscape, and what we identifies as opportunities for interception/acquisition. _(We plan to do a presentation on this by Thursday at All Hands. )_

In mapping out the orderflow market landscape, we create a literal “transaction supply map” of every major actor in the ecosystem: web traffic - front ends - swap facilities - aggregation routers - resolvers/solvers - market makers / AMMs / OTC desks. It’s super interesting to see where each actor fit and where they acquire /share their orderflow, and why. This map help inform the foundation of our baseline understanding of the orderflow ecosystem, user growth, and align our mental model in terms of our product positioning for Protect, MEV-Share, builder along the orderflow stack. 

However, there are blind spots and inaccurate understandings of what we are working on. These are fogged territories on our map. Hence during this week, we are reaching out to our ecosystem partners within our network, selectively and cautiously, in the context of “orderflow market structure data research” so that it does not interfere with our outreach for product, strategic partnerships, fundraising initiatives. 

<@U03G59ZN90D> let’s compile our questions + notes for each of the ecosystem partners we are running our spot check interviews on in this thread for visibility, and store them in the key stakeholder CRM.

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 15/08/2023 18:47:21 Z:
A guy named Edi Sinovcic reached out to me on twitter to ask about synthesis between his company spaceshard and suave. tl;dr of meeting:
• edi is a Zk guy but got out of the tech 5y ago bc it was too early
• worked on solidity stuff at EF for a few years
• founded shard labs that does DeFi (mostly liquid staking on polygon and another chain i dont remember)
• Wants to get back into zk so incubated spaceshard under shard labs (both basically seem like his company)
*what does spaceshard do?* 
allows users to interact with L1 defi via a zkrollup. In this sense its very similar to suave in that users use spaceshard's rollup to permute the state of another chain. Right now the biggest value props they're thinking about are UX through things like native AA and gas-cost savings on L1. They're running on starkware's stuff at the moment and plan to go live in Sept with an initial version which has proof time at 6 hours.

*relevance*
I don't think there's anything to do immediately, but its worth noting that they're addressing a similar problem to us - user coordination for efficient use of L1 - but coming at it from a very different angle. As their tech improves and we add more software crypto, we could end up competing with them/using some of their tech

|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 15/08/2023 18:57:04 Z:
|   yeah the point at which we start competing is when their proving reaches a point at which it operates at mev time

_Tina, Reid, Ken Ng_ 

*Goals*:
- Align with Uniswap Foundation on commitment to PBS Guild
- Explore interest in participating in DOWG
- Explore collaboration on mapping defi orderflow

*Projects*: PBS Guild; DOWG; SUAVE

*TLDR:*
• Uniswap Foundation is open to committing funds to PBS Guild and to become a member of DOWG. 
• Uniswap Foundation’s mandate is to ensure sustainability and decentralization of the Uniswap Protocol. Ken mentioned (paraphrased) “If Uniswap X takes over all Uniswap flow, that would negatively impact the Uniswap Protocol. We hope to push other entities, through grants, to run frontends for v3 and v2.” Ken described the relationship as in some areas not necessarily dedicated to the same outcomes, specifically mentioning decentralization. 
• We discussed collaborating on a project to map orderflow. Ken / UF is interested because they need to invest time into projects that illuminate areas in which their community can build tools/products in the orderflow stack to further decentralize the infrastructure stack for the Uniswap Protocol (right now too reliant on Labs and UF hasn’t done a good enough job to tell community entities where they can do things). 
• Ken is open to discussing SUAVE collaborations.
*Action Items:*
- PBS Guild proposal to UF for engagement as a financial contributor
- Explore submitting proposal for PBS Guild to Uniswap DAO
- Follow up on orderflow data mapping project with other members of the UF team (Ben Bosch)
- Setup call for SUAVE exploration

Tina, Reid, Simon Brown

*Goal*: PBS Guild participation and funding
*Project*: PBS Guild

*TLDR*: Simon Brown is interested in serving as a grant committee member for PBS Guild. He has advised that Consensys is most likely to contribute funding through a grant from Linea as PBS work is related to the layer two’s decentralized sequencer project.

^ General flag — the Stakeholder CRM is a hot mess. I’m not blaming any specific parties. I recognize maintainers have changed hands repeatedly. Still, I think we need a better system. No one is using it the same way. I can’t navigate the 20 random fields at the top of each new project page, :sos: all around. 

Is it time to migrate to an official CRM tool? 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 17/08/2023 13:40:06 Z:
|   Soft argument as to why we shouldn’t: Additional tools can cause friction and be even harder to keep up to date
|   
|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 17/08/2023 13:52:58 Z:
|   I have migrated multiple CRM tools. IRL they are all terrible and the excess amount of fields is not mitigated in the long term. Cleaning up your complains about the notion page is likely as easy a solution. Cleaning notion is potentially a better UX than a distinct tool from all our notes.
|   
|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 17/08/2023 15:15:04 Z:
|   Ok appreciate the insight here 
|   Perhaps a cleanup plan is in order
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 17/08/2023 19:11:38 Z:
|   I usually ignore the fields and just focus on the content in the actual page (meeting notes etc). It seems like people tend to add fields that are relevant to certain sub-tables or projects but might not have an entry globally for all projects in the CRM. I’ve been fine just ignoring that part if it doesn’t matter to me — maybe there’s a specific action to make it clear if a select subset of fields are important and highlight them, while allowing space for people to add customizations that others can ignore

|   Token2049 is a legitimate event and has been one of the longest running crypto conferences in Asia. For a period of time they tried to expand to more cities (with a London event) but their signature event in Singapore. It is one of the key events in asia each year with a high concentration of builders (but still a lot of investors and randos)

Token2049 Singapore coincides each year with Singapore Blockchain Week -- where there are also many other high ev things happening!

• largest crypto event in Asia without question
• heavy presence of miners and mining farms
• mostly Asia investor and BD people trying to get and close deals. don’t expect much in-depth discussion with builders or researchers

|   activity is definitely not limited to ETH for sure. They mine all sorts of things… basically anything you can mine with a big enough name/funding/ecosystem to dump later. Things like Aleo

<@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03G59ZN90D> really cool work! Feel like I was blind and now I can see :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Some questions:

• <@U03GRQX5HGR> you said that cowswap is popular among whales bc it has good execution. Are you saying cowswap>RFQ for whale trades?
• How are 1inch orders that aren't matched against active liquidity executed today? Who routes them?
• Are there aggregators/RFQ routers which route matched orders (as opposed to having the solvers route like in cowswap)?
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/08/2023 15:09:41 Z:
|   1. No, we just observed on-chain that trades that go through cowswap are predominantly big trades. Cowswap is light blue in this graph.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/08/2023 15:12:15 Z:
|   2. 1inch finds the best route by “sampling” the pmms and amms, likely pinging these venues for quotes of different sizes. (cc <@U05578MHMUZ>)

So it could be that trades end up being split 20% amm and 80% pmm.

1inch executes the route they find on-chain.
|   how are you using the word “route”? does it encompass both finding the best path and submitting the transaction on chain?
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 18/08/2023 15:14:36 Z:
|   Yeah sorry. I meant submitting tx to chain (all the offchain stuff) not routing the trade itself against passive liq
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/08/2023 15:16:30 Z:
|   they route across active liquidity (pmm) and passive liquidity (amm)
|   i believe that in every case outside of cowswap and 1inch fusion, the aggregator/rfq will submit the tx on-chain

George -- open to your comments and adjustments to it. We should be able to filter in all the new entries you've made recently.
|   Great to hear re: Trust Wallet. Its incredible actually what Alchemy is doing with smart tx, leveraging us for free and then charing through their infra. But I am curious how it works since we don't route tx that are non-mev to them any more.
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 23/08/2023 16:30:18 Z:

• Good developer experience through docs and customer support
• Active sales through a very effective sales team

<@U03G59ZN90D> <@U03GRQX5HGR> In contact on WeChat with Bitget wallet CEO, who is actually also their head PM and very hands on.

They already use Protect for Ethereum tx as a option but probably did not push for it hard enough in terms of UX so the adoption is still a bit low. They haven’t learned about MEV Share and got interested after the pitch.

Important pattern here btw. Many Chinese projects’ top executives are NOT fluent English speakers and often delegate English based communication to lower ranking officers. Finding them on WeChat AND speaking Chinese are often the fastest way to push things forward.

<@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03G59ZN90D> Are we documenting notes from the conversations we are having with ecosystem members?

We've found readouts like <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C03FCJJ4UN7/p1692304313853279|this> are most efficient for the cross-org and cross-team interface and reduce coordination overhead

*Hi everyone, I wanted to provide a quick update on DOWG and also provide some documents for review.* 

DOWG was first conceived in April 2023 as a response to our internal impass over orderflow sharing for mev-share. The debate at the time: should our OFA be an orderflow aggregator that shares orderflow with multiple builders to achieve optimal inclusion rates or should we be mindful of the trust we would be placing in the builders to the potential detriment of users in a scenario where a builder unbundles a mev-share bundle or where a searcher-builder uses their view of mev-share txs to build better blocks.

This led us, namely <@U03PZSSETQA> (+Viktor), to come up with an alternative, middle ground solution -- in the absence of a technological solution to orderflow sharing, lets create a social layer of trust between the top builders and the top orderflow providers in a set of fair market principles. This allowed us to provide soft assurances to orderflow providers about user guarantees and to set concretely the do's and don'ts for our builder friends. The <https://hackmd.io/@Flashbots/fair-market-principles|fair market principles> were subsequently ratified by all major builders and were officially turned on opt-in orderflow sharing earlier this month!

But there is still a lot of work to do -- we do need to find solutions to trustless orderflow sharing and to consolidate the design space around OFA design, but tackling these problems head on is resource intensive and not exactly a priority internally with SUAVE development underway. So we've examined the best path forward for DOWG in the mindset of how can we align the industry around these problems --> by starting work on smaller objectives with data APIs, execution definitions, and UX/UI best practices for OFAs.

DOWG will break out into three working groups (with the option to add more in the future). We've been able to tap external collaborators to lead two of them and are looking for a third presently. The idea is to allow the community to take on the collective responsibility of *decentralizing the orderflow* and allow DOWG to act as forum for those discussions and ultimately the R&D work in the open as well.

*- Data Transparency Working Group* - Saj Zouhari from Blocknative
*- Execution Standards Working Group* - Mikolaj Barczentewicz (legal researcher) and Natasha Vasan (3L at UMich Law, previously time at Uniswap, Coinbase, Blockchain Capital, David Polk)
*- OFA Design Working Group* - TBD

|   Disregard this message! I confused this initiative with a different one :heart:

~Hello, thanks for the readout and transparency. I have not yet read the proposal, but have a high-level question.~ 

~Are these efforts separate from Suave integration meetings? I’m concerned how messy holding separate OFA adoption discussions at the same time were having Suapp integration calls may be.~

~I’m imagining scenarios where meetings are held to ask OFA teams to send OF to protect / mev-share shorter-term, but there’s no mention of building out their OFAs as a Suapp longer-term. Longer-term, this division also could have implications on how partner orderflow should be split if they do build a Suapp (e.g. Rigil RPC vs Mev-share RPC).~ 

~It may be important these efforts are very closely tracking or embedded into the relevant product teams to avoid harmful effects to both efforts.~ 
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 23/08/2023 15:50:35 Z:
|   Thank you, Kailin! If you don't mind -- I am going to take this convo out of the thread on DOWG and make a new post in this channel to discuss.

To answer quickly though on DOWG -- there are no  integration calls through DOWG for mev-share.

DOWG is just a place for industry to discuss big topics and align on R&D. I'll try to ship a post connecting SUAVE and DOWG later this week!! (in the mean time, <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Connecting-the-dots-between-MEV-Share-Builder-Solidity-and-DOWG-e3318e0122ad42019c95eaae453d0062|here is an old one from Shea>, a little outdated but a good start)

|   Reviewed the notion and will look at updated charter next.

I’d note that DOWG was not created as a “response to our internal impasse over orderflow sharing for mev-share”. It was originally created as a vehicle for mev share adoption/R&D on OF sharing. We subsequently realized it was also an ideal way to align on and own the FMPs.

Over time DOWG’s purpose has shifted, in part because of timing and changes in internal goals. It’s now much less of a vessel for mev share adoption and has been repurposed for other means. That was the reason we created it though.

|   very interesting perception from each part of the org, my view was: DOWG was not created for mev-share "adoption"... it was a vehicle to align the key stakeholders around our mission (why we created an privacy centric OFA protocol in the first place) on a technical (MEV-Share standard) and social level (FMP), as we iterate towards SUAVE. A positive externality is the ability for us to uphold a standard via social norm for us to share orderflow.

Review would be appreciated, by EOD Tuesday next week is ideal!

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Decentralized-Operations-Working-Group-s-v2-eec9cc2f4bc54106b01dcbf5972ca356>

The substance of the update from v1 to v2:
• updated org name to Operations from Orderflow following feedback from counsel, external advisors, and key stakeholders including Coinbase. 
• removed OFA working group
• defined direction "_a forum to align industry efforts towards a decentralized future through research and development and best practices."_ 
• developed a clearer picture of what dowg has been and can be leveraging the fmp use case. This has resonated greatly in a few member pitches (most notably with Rebecca Rettig at Polygon), where I've been made aware of smaller groups looking for outlets to work on similar topics but unable to find the right balance between formality and participation. The feedback was positive on the working group structure. 
*Decentralized Operations Working Group (DOWG)*

_The Decentralized Operations Working Group (DOWG) is a forum to align industry efforts towards a decentralized future through research and development and best practices._

DOWG was established in April 2023 as the Decentralized Orderflow Working Group to set fair market principles for orderflow sharing between orderflow auctions (OFAs) and block builders. Today, most OFAs either share orderflow to multiple builders by default or give users the ability to share orderflow with selected block builders. The fair market principles remain the primary binding agent between block builders and OFAs to enable trusted orderflow sharing.

The creation of these principles was an important milestone. It demonstrated the industry’s ability to establish best practices where decentralized solutions are still being researched and developed.

More areas exist where industry can align efforts for market integrity, transparency, and fairness while on the road to a decentralized future. At EthCC Paris 2023 in July, DOWG members organized Orderflow.Salon to explore these areas and, as a result, established two new DOWG working groups on transparency and execution.

|   I think it’s pretty good! There’s one thing that caught my attention — slightly off the cuff thoughts below

Part of the original pitch was around standardizing the guarantees and interfaces for OFAs to make things easy for everyone who integrates with them. I recognize that we’ve intentionally moved away from this direction (“MEV-Share protocol adoption”) for good reasons but I wonder if there’s a twist on it that’s actually still relevant and ties those original conversations together with the new charter.

Idea is something like: DOWG was established to align the industry on standards for how orderflow is shared between participants (providers/auctions/builders/etc). The FMPs are one instance of these standards.

This way we’re not saying that DOWG was just created for the FMPs, which felt a bit overly specific on my first read. And I think the idea of a standards body is generally consistent with where we’re going with DOWG now — aligning on definitions and “rules” and standards for how we treat orderflow.

|   Also if we really _have_ to change the name then so be it… but… “decentralized operations working group” feels a bit meaningless/meh. “Orderflow” is something I can envision but the new title sort of goes in one ear and goes out the other. That is my scathing review.

|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 09/09/2023 08:43:54 Z:
|   re: name -- it's a regulatory dogwhistle. The upside to operations is that this is a key theme we are seeing for all of defi -- how do they decentralize their operations; how do make credibly neutral decisions; how do we as an industry further explain the difference between software and services through truly decentralized operations. Further, decentralizing operations is the thing we are trying to achieve: the reason we needed fpm was because we don't yet have a means of a credibly neutral block builder. Operations is also a more direct pathway to SUAVE: have you come to the conclusion that you need to decentralize your operations? Build your project in MEVM on SUAVE. Lastly, Orderflow is narrow compared to Operations and expands the range of the group.

*Partnerships and Stakeholder Outreach*

I am sharing some simple short term steps to triage potential outreach overlap on mev-share and SUAVE following some internal requests to help and seeing some messages in this channel and others.

Status:
• *Product is driving SUAVE integrations meetings*
    ◦ Does there exist a dashboard or a list of these meetings? If not, totally fine! I would suggest a weekly post in this channel with conversations scheduled for the week that also has a running list of targets. This would help with visibility and also might lead to additional context or connections from other mates! 
• *Tina, Angela, George are conducting outreach to Asian orderflow providers this week for mev-share integrations*
    ◦ Does there exist a dashboard or a list of these meetings? If not, totally fine! I would suggest a weekly post in this channel with conversations scheduled for the week that also has a running list of targets (although I believe this is a sprint just for this week and not an ongoing project). This would help with visibility and also might lead to additional context or connections from other mates! 
Unanswered:
• What is our current understanding of the future relationship between Rigil RPC and Protect+ RPC? 
• What should be mentioned to mev-share integrators about SUAVE, if anything at all at this stage?
Additional points of clarification:
• mev-share adoption is focused just on asian wallets at the moment, if there are asian wallets on the high priority suave integration list, please flag -- also, generally, Tina/George will have good insights on that market and how to engage properly (might need a native speaker). 
• DOWG has been pivoted from just about mev-share to something that can be leveraged for both OFAs and for items relevant to SUAVE such as provable best execution. 
• yes -- we do need a better solution to Stakeholder CRM
• yes -- Stakeholder CRM is clunky and has sporadic data and information, but it still does contain a huge amount of internal knowledge and it can serve our short term needs. I would suggest (especially if no dashboard re: above for SUAVE calls) making a specific view our of the database for specific workstreams rather than trying to use the master view as a whole. George and I are happy to help set these up (<@U03TG3UMZFD> you can officially retire from Stakeholder CRM management)

|   Inspo for this thread:

I’m concerned how messy holding separate OFA adoption discussions at the same time were having Suapp integration calls may be.

I’m imagining scenarios where meetings are held to ask OFA teams to send OF to protect / mev-share shorter-term, but there’s no mention of building out their OFAs as a Suapp longer-term. Longer-term, this division also could have implications on how partner orderflow should be split if they do build a Suapp (e.g. Rigil RPC vs Mev-share RPC).

It may be important these efforts are very closely tracking or embedded into the relevant product teams to avoid harmful effects to both efforts.

|   "I’m imagining scenarios where meetings are held to ask OFA teams to send OF to protect / mev-share shorter-term, but there’s no mention of building out their OFAs as a Suapp longer-term."

Is there a further distinction here between OFA and Orderflow Provider? I'm not sure of any conversations (now or in the past) where we were approaching OFAs themselves to send their orderflow to protect -- other OFAs would be competitors to Protect. Focus has only been orderflow providers
|   
|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 25/08/2023 15:06:17 Z:
|   Separation between Wallet / OFA becoming blurrier due to mev-share OF sharing, and it’s happening for reasons other than adoption. Lots of nuance depending on team. concrete example is mev-blocker / cowswap, where request they send to Protect stemmed from improved inclusion rates. 

But yeah, OFA / wallet sending to Protect is the premise of OF sharing

|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 25/08/2023 15:25:52 Z:
|   hmm, I might still not be getting it. I appreciate you typing it out.

1. wallet / dapp (orderflow providers) that have an OFA relationship already fall into one category (mevblocker/cowswap example) and these are more relevant for suapp convos. 
2. wallet / dapp (orderflow providers) that do not have an OFA relationship fall into another category (rainbow or IM token (who have chosen mev-share but just using as example)) and these are more relevant for ensuring they adopt mev-share / protect+

?

|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 25/08/2023 16:06:10 Z:
|   My point is just that all of these things are related and we can’t draw a perfect line in the sand.

Think product needs to figure out how we should parallelize efforts and resources on each product and what the narrative to external parties should be for how suave and mev-share relate at this stage before we push hard

|   Can you define more "as UBI"?

Does this mean that instead of refunds to users that generate the refund, you would instead pitch as it to be pooled and distributed to all users of the wallet equally at set intervals?

This is something that has been talked about before -- creative ways wallets could leverage refunds, and creating a design space  where more strategies than just mevsend_refund to user.
|   
|   > Leonardo Arias [U03G97GK4JZ] @ 23/08/2023 17:38:01 Z:
|   Yes, maybe. That's for them to define. I have a few experiments in mind to propose, maybe even involving gitcoin and playing a reverse game of what they are doing with shell.
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 23/08/2023 17:49:53 Z:
|   does this hurt general welfare?

statistically, mev generating txs come from more well-off individuals in terms of total assets in wallet, but also it could be just general unsophisticated users. In the sense that UBI, in your opinion, is a redistributive mechanism vs. a general welfare? -- where do the funds need to come from to be considered UBI? Can it be redistributive from haves to have nots and are we able to certify that in this case?

additionally, redistribution to all wallets might disproportionately send mev refunds to inactive wallets or burner wallets owned by many vs. thinking that 1 wallet = 1 person and no over lap. Maybe we could work to define a level of activity to be elligible for UBI in this case.
|   
|   > Leonardo Arias [U03G97GK4JZ] @ 24/08/2023 17:23:20 Z:
|   All of those questions are part of what has to be designed. I want many experiments in the blockchain so we play with different details.
|   You might find this one interesting:
<https://therules.org/case-studies/universal-basic-income-case-study/|https://therules.org/case-studies/universal-basic-income-case-study/>
It's a change of narrative, pushing us away from the minutiae of the implementation and away from quantified notions, from pretending we can compare and evaluate these things.
|   I think that if the narrative is about wellbeing and not wellfare, the response to those questions comes from a different place in the body, a different place in the hierarchy and a different place in history, that makes for a cooler post capitalist experiment.
|   But well, can I talk to rainbow now? Or any other recommendations?

<@U03PZSSETQA> We are getting some mev-share integration requests from bitkeep and pokt already, and likely more soon.
• How would you prefer to handle these / interface between coordination and product?
• Is there an integration doc they can follow? An updated template message stating the value proposition & what they should expect?
• How would you prefer them to integrate? (I believe we want them to set their origin id ala tokenlon?)

|   I have an idea, we ran into similar issues at the beginning of mev-geth adoption, and recently  with fundraising workstreams where our product, or narrative or pitch changes too fast for docs and knowledge reservoir to pick up, and then our capacity was bottle necked in a couple people.
What sort of worked and we can intentionally experiment in this case, is we can interview <@U03PZSSETQA> and key stakeholder from product on what are the latest mev-share product changes lately, and summarize the key responses <@U03PZSSETQA> provide async, into an FAQ. We can asynchronously identify outdated spots in docs and patch them up, esp <@U05DY4WTLUB> is working on docs already.
|   FAQ is team productivity hack, later on we can build up more systematic efforts around internal knowledge base.
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> can you share what do you mean by "what product team is doing" and where we can best find these that are related to what you have on your mind?

|   <@U03PZSSETQA> these are great documents (as always, love the clarity). I see these can be a core documents that address the goals that we should align ourselves around the adoption efforts, and I like how it lays out specifically the product side of work that is critical for sustainable growth. 
In some sense, you can think about it this way, to achieve this ambitious goal, you need a team, specialists, experts to actually carry out the non-product parts.
How do we establish effective interfaces with these internal specialists, is key to how we can scale our work. A case in point is the data work around mev-share data publishing.

Product owner created the initiative, but product org internally needs to focus on certain priorities, whereas data team has rough consensus as well as expertise on how to do this well and do it right. We landed at a good spot - data team should be empowered to take ownership in execution, and product owners are definitely key stakeholders whose objectives are respected and they will be closely consulted, amongst other key stakeholders of the project.

Broadly — it seems like we’ll need some more support from product to make this effort successful. Candidly I’d love to do that but am not sure what bandwidth is needed / available for this specific kind of work. We’re also thinking about adoption but still in the “understand users and needs” phase, not quite in a place to support mass outreach yet.

Right now it's unclear if it's a "process" question regarding how we work together, or "goal" issue as to are we aligned, or "vibes" issue, or "accuracy" issue as to information symmetry, or "expectation" issue as to align upfront so not be surprised, or "who's the final decision maker" issue as to reduce the number of cooks in the kitchen, or "trust" in our teammates' expertise or ability or having the proper context.

Today <@U03GRQX5HGR>, <@U02CJ9QVAL9>, <@U03PZSSETQA>, and I met to discuss adoption activities and how Coordination and Product can best collaborate. We agreed upon 2 service-level-agreements (SLAs) we think all members of Product and Coordination should uphold when engaging in ecosystem or adoption activities. We formalized these in an <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Service-Level-Agreements-SLAs-70fd1cb99def46b4804cd9d95e73505f|SLAs Notion page> we can use for all SLAs going forward. It holds a database of approvers, dates, and status of each SLA to ensure we all hold ourselves accountable. :rocket:

*Here are the Ecosystem / Adoption SLAs we agreed to today:*
1. *SLA to share a 1-page brief on any new adoption or ecosystem initiative or experiment:* Agree to tag relevant product members (like Reid did with DOWG recently) in #ecosystem-channel *before initiative kick-off*. Brief will include initiative’ purpose, objectives, narratives and/or mental models to be shared, and review deadline. *SLA Goal*: to make sure new initiatives are communicated to product owner(s). Ideally there is buy-in from Product before kick-off. Product to also continue to share RFPs / RFCs and circulate them to relevant parties.
2. *SLA for notes in CRM:* external partner calls by any coordination or product member will be documented in the <https://www.notion.so/4e31c9295f344ab1af32085bc62e7c9e?v=6f411326dd7d42aaaf115e0b6352246c|Stakeholder CRM>. A link to these notes and a summary of discussion will be shared in #ecosystem-channel for awareness. *SLA Goal:* Communication consistency and transparency.
*Adoption Effort Ownership:*
• Early Product initiatives (like Suave) are owned by Product. Once clear use-cases, guarantees, and strategic intuitions materialize into concrete plans/ narratives Coordination can digest and execute on, we engage Coordination!
• Coordination engagement on ecosystem or adoption efforts  (e.g. more mature products like Protect) implies Coordination members will integrate more closely with Product teams. This can be achieved through product meeting attendance, documentation deep-dives, 1:1's etc) in order to support goals knowledgeably.

As a next step <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U03QCGC3SL9> <@U03PZSSETQA> can you all please take the time to think about the mutual expectations we have of each other here and review what <@U03QCGC3SL9> has wrote already, signaling your buy-in with an approval in the boxes on the notion page?

Ideally we can express these expectations in concrete measurable metrics.

I think this is super important for improving the interface and coordinating better. I'd end of week for a first draft (beyond what Kailin read out), next wednesday for finalizing :slightly_smiling_face:

|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 31/08/2023 13:29:41 Z:
|   The Adoption Effort Ownership bullets are great! Ton's of added clarity there.

I put down some <https://collective.flashbots.net/t/a-response-to-the-sla-proposal/2311|thoughts> on SLAs as an idea and suggested an alternative framing for the project management document.

• SLA proposal for collaboration between Coordination and Product pushes the two teams farther apart rather than bringing us closer together.
• SLA proposal should be replaced with general project management documentation following the RACI matrix for accountability and ownership.
• Relations between Coordination and Product would benefit from a reset: we should view team collaboration not as an inefficiency, but instead as an untapped super power that will maximize efficiency.
I also suggest that we should take some time to have a reset between the teams which should also include some more direct feedback mate to mate and team to team on what has gone awry, as an important step to repairing the trust between the teams.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 31/08/2023 17:31:06 Z:
|   <@U04QCPQ0CG5> I hear what you are saying - SLAs do not foster trust but can come across as alienating if taken out of context. We are humans, mutual respect and appreciation for clarity can go a much longer way than "contracts" that only take care of the minimum requirements. SLAs alone doesn't help us thrive, or feel like ONE winning team. They are there to help define our communications protocols. They are the outcome (and a small part) of our mutual commitments to contribute to _Commons_ projects such as CRMs, partnerships, knowledgebase, etc.

That said, if we, the humans who make the make the magic happen, who are the bearers and solvers of uncertainty with our experience, wisdom, creativity and care for each other, choose to _interpret_ the SLAs as one critical but insufficient condition in our shared desire for improving coordination, API documents can be a constructive tool and can force function clarity of expectation for any cross functional collaboration.

Separately thank you for bringing up the importance of project documentation (I 100% agree with you there) - this is already within our requirement for team leads to establish, what's missing has been actually jointly defined ownership and agreed upon workflow. Great call for using RACI matrix for shared ownership across functions, let's incorporate this into best practice, and take a project as pilots, within the ecosystem team? Let me know what you think! 

(Cc. <@U05NYEHJUUW> let's help work on this together. <@U03TG3UMZFD> can you review and share Chelsea's notes from Monday, I know it's already on our notion page but please link as a read out, and please make sure <@U04QCPQ0CG5> has access to it. thanks)

QQ: I just noticed that a meeting note I created for a CRM stakeholder does not actually appear embedded in the page of that stakeholder.
• Here’s the meeting note: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Chat-with-Wayne-ba7d414bb1654d4d840bc059272c887d>
• I created it for this stakeholder but as you can see their page doesn’t have it linked: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Rainbow-ec64473b4f4b45809aa4a27e0a3bb9b3>
<@U03TG3UMZFD> was there a manual step to embed meeting notes in each page? Maybe that process just didn’t get finished. Wanted to flag since otherwise people will probably miss the notes.

|   > Danny M [U03TG3UMZFD] @ 28/08/2023 22:07:27 Z:
|   it is automatically listed in the backlinks when you do that.

however, there is a caveat that the CRM cleanup / structure was never rolled out to in full. There is a step on the CRM record where you add the notes database and filter by that record type. its part admin lift to get it rolled out across the crm.

<@U03FP0H62HH> and I talked to Fireblocks. A 3 bullet point tl;dr:
• They are interested in integrating. A dead simple value prop of "low latency frontrunning and revert protection plus MEV back" is compelling. We just need to sell it to the right people.
• They were interested in configuring it differently for different customers, and monetizing their MEV as well.
• They will do more research and get back to us about integrating. We'll likely need to help them parameterize.

Heads-up: we are doing our end of August sweep of ecosystem round partners, we will follow up with some of the top orderflow providers on strategy and product alignment on their updated investment interest such as 1inch, and will share the full list later this week. This will bring attention to our products and to SUAVE in September. 

No actions needed yet as the fundraising team will take care of most of their immediate asks, and triage to relevant stakeholders internally. However, there will likely be more product inquiries, and more attention on our docs <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U02CJ9QVAL9>.

> Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 30/08/2023 11:07:23 Z:
Update: we had a great 3rd convo with Uniswap Foundation on our potential partnership, super promising, here's a tldr, (will write up full meeting notes later this week when I catch some sleep):
• UF will soon have $60m to deploy to support Uniswap ecosystem in the next 3-5 years. 
• Next year budget they expect 1/3 funding going to mechanism designs, and the rest not yet scoped out. They have a 1.5m contract with Gauntlet to do governance simulations (if I heard correctly? <@U03TG3UMZFD> <@U03HT20PJES>)
• MEV is the main direction they would love to explore with us, esp SUAVE collab. 
• UF mission is supporting decentralization and PBS Guild is fully aligned
We arrived at some high level areas of collaboration in Q4, to be scoped out in the next 1-2 months:
1. Identify a beacon project, such as Uniswap on SUAVE (we jokingly called it _unisuave,_ UF can give a grant to us upfront to spec it out (based on Gauntet's grant size, I'm guessing this can be 0.5-1.5m for flashbots for design and prototyping.
2. , and followed with subsequent grants either to us or to ecosystem teams for implementation (they can help us find capable teams if we don't think building in house make sense. 
3. Additional orderflow related experiment of research that brings value to Uni v4, v3, etc
4.  _They got excited by a bunch of s_uave ideas _<@U03GKHM4G9Z>_ _<@U03HT20PJES> came up with. Details to come_.
5. They are down to do a "hookathon" in Istanbul with us in November (<@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U03TD87PTMK>). focused on SUAVE and Uniswap. Would be cool to know if we think SUAVE testnet will be up then. <@U02CJ9QVAL9> 
6. UF will be able to give a 50-100k grant to PBS guild asap, pending KYC. This may be just initial funding, there can be more coming. 
|   
|   > Kailin [U03QCGC3SL9] @ 30/08/2023 12:01:46 Z:
|   thanks for the summary <@U03GRQX5HGR>! A few requests:
• In future, can you also tag <@U05BMHJMRNK>, <@U03G3CSRBQR>, and I on anything that has to do with Suave integrations? 
• Also, can you please share the link to the full notes in the Stakeholder CRM per our <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Ecosystem-and-Adoption-SLAs-6450d3d4c1f940d69931e69a49bc6dcf|SLAs>? I’d be very interested to read about the “_bunch of s_uave ideas _<@U03GKHM4G9Z>_ _<@U03HT20PJES> came up with. Details to come_.” Maybe <@U05NYEHJUUW> owns this?
Other questions:
1. Who attended this meeting on our side and on UniX’s side? Specifically, who is the UniX point-of-contact for Dan, Robert, and I to kick-off the PoC conversation once ready? 
2. Do we want / need this grant to spec out UniSuave? cc <@U02CJ9QVAL9>. We were going to do this anyway. Either way, it would be really interesting to give grants to the broader ecosystem to spur development.  
3. <@U03G3CSRBQR> was discussing going to Istanbul today, but I’d personally prefer small and focused white-boarding jams w/ suave core members + UniX devs before any complicated events are planned. We would want early feedback from them. Perhaps this is what a hookathon is, but want to manage expectations. Maybe future ‘grants + unisuave ecosystem events’ could come later.

|   There's a good chance testnet will be up middle of November. At least we'll have pretty good local devnet tooling, that'll be ready way before. Fwiw, <@U02CJ9QVAL9> is owning the Uniswap+SUAVE collaboration, which is already starting now.

2 - i don’t have explicit notes of Phil’s ideas. Something to do with providing privacy to passive LPs. :confused_dog: 
3 - attendees in the link above. Was UF team and Phil, Tina, Quintus and me. There were not any Products folks. 
4- the UF is not the right point of contact for UniX. We were just jamming on areas to collaborate. It was surface level. 
5 - my understanding of the grant was for others in ecosystem to hack on implementations of the spec. So the spec would exist first then grants would be offered around building and PoCs. 
6 - my understanding was the hookathon was maybe the above. We were quite explicit that we needed to talk to Robert on viability and timelines.

The key take away is the UF is well funded and has 2 explicit goals. 1 is improvement to best execution. 2 is improve LP profitability. They think SUAVE and or Flashbots will be able to further one or both mandates. As a result they wanted to open the conversation and let us know their financial support is only dependent on us identifying where the UF should direct their time and funds.

|   Just flagging to prevent misunderstanding, UF (firewalled from Uniswap Labs) is not in charge of UniX, but Uni v4, v3, etc and token holder interests. I will build on full notes from Danny, and <@U02CJ9QVAL9> we chatted with Ken that today or tomorrow, we may have a follow up meeting when you arrive, to touch on more specific product areas.

The meeting was primarily a preliminary research and grants convo, and meet and greet. Ken Ng will be the point person from UF side.

|   <@U03QCGC3SL9> I'm the PoC for UniX/SUAVE. I don't know the Uni foundation people as well (although Ken and I go back like 5 years).

I think for UniX we probably want to do / can't outsource the work of figuring out that integration ourselves.

From the POV of the UF I think we could work with them on developing a bunch of novel DEX capabilities that would also align with Uni labs / UniX. Batch auctions come to mind - but really any kind of more complicated auction / dex you can't do on Ethereum would be a candidate. <@U03HT20PJES> would have ideas here, I'm sure. If you forced me to choose a beacon project right now I'd ask them for $1m to design and prototype a sealed bid single clearing price batch auction because that's also what Dan R wanted so there would be synergy/alignment across us, Uni Labs, and the UF (and we'd be doing the work anyway, better to get paid for it and give those parties a win).

Like Chris said, SUAVE testnet likely by then although I'm not sure immediately that there is much synergy between that release and Uni v4 we could still cobrand for a hackathon. I'd defer to <@U03QCGC3SL9> and <@U05BMHJMRNK> on strategy for the hackathon.

|   > Chelsea A. Peterson [U05NYEHJUUW] @ 30/08/2023 18:34:36 Z:
|   There's no tension per se, but they are separate entities that inform one another on things
|   UF meets with UL on a weekly basis with the core teams and then on a monthly basis with the larger team, so comms lines are open and they work in tandem / complementarily
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 05/09/2023 06:30:26 Z:
|   Examples of possible collabs/projs to fund that came up in the meeting:
• UniX auctions 
• Liquidity providers can post private liquidity on suave
• Grants for uniswap/unix related libraries in the MEVM
• Pools with effectively lower block time (but still clearing on eth) instead of Al N's centralised fcfs offchain sequencer
• First-access-to-pool auctions
<@U02CJ9QVAL9> I think we should come with some suggestions to Dan R and co on an auction format, but I assume they'll also want input. There are tradeoffs for auction format and privacy depending on things like volume. <@U052RRMC25R> has put a deal of thought into this. Who is leading the UniX PoC? happy to put more thought into it \

|   > Sergio Yuhjtman [U052RRMC25R] @ 06/09/2023 04:29:49 Z:
|   <@U02CJ9QVAL9> You mention "single clearing price batch auction" as the beacon project. I think we should preferrably call this simply "Walrasian auction", for both brevity and economics context.
There is also an important advantage if everybody knows and agrees that we are talking about the same thing.
<@U05DA3HK5RN>'s opinion might be relevant here.
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 06/09/2023 07:44:16 Z:
|   Is every single-clearing price auction walrasian? i had walrasian as an instance of the former in my mind (e.g. I didn't think of cowswap as walrasian)
|   
|   > Christoph [U05DA3HK5RN] @ 06/09/2023 16:22:06 Z:
|   <@U052RRMC25R> <@U03HT20PJES> Technically, a Walrasian auction is an auction that implements equilibrium prices: prices clear your market and there is also equilibrium between different markets so that nobody has an incentive to trade after the auction.
|   
|   > Christoph [U05DA3HK5RN] @ 06/09/2023 16:31:40 Z:
|   So you can call cowswap Walrasian at least in spirit
|   
|   > Sergio Yuhjtman [U052RRMC25R] @ 06/09/2023 16:31:48 Z:
|   We want to do "sealed bid single clearing price batch auction" on SUAVE.
This means a system that receives orders, finds the solution prices (one price for each relevant token), and executes every order at those prices, without censoring orders.
I think it is a good idea to call this a Walrasian auction, even if some technicality (like operative cost) makes this slightly different from the ideal Walrasian auction.

<@U04QCPQ0CG5> I hear what you are saying - SLAs do not foster trust but can come across as alienating if taken out of context. We are humans, mutual respect and appreciation for clarity can go a much longer way than "contracts" that only take care of the minimum requirements. SLAs alone doesn't help us thrive, or feel like ONE winning team. They are there to help define our communications protocols. They are the outcome (and a small part) of our mutual commitments to contribute to _Commons_ projects such as CRMs, partnerships, knowledgebase, etc.

That said, if we, the humans who make the make the magic happen, who are the bearers and solvers of uncertainty with our experience, wisdom, creativity and care for each other, choose to _interpret_ the SLAs as one critical but insufficient condition in our shared desire for improving coordination, API documents can be a constructive tool and can force function clarity of expectation for any cross functional collaboration.

Separately thank you for bringing up the importance of project documentation (I 100% agree with you there) - this is already within our requirement for team leads to establish, what's missing has been actually jointly defined ownership and agreed upon workflow. Great call for using RACI matrix for shared ownership across functions, let's incorporate this into best practice, and take a project as pilots, within the ecosystem team? Let me know what you think! 

(Cc. <@U05NYEHJUUW> let's help work on this together. <@U03TG3UMZFD> can you review and share Chelsea's notes from Monday, I know it's already on our notion page but please link as a read out, and please make sure <@U04QCPQ0CG5> has access to it. thanks)

*Polygon (Policy)*

I spoke with Rebecca Rettig, Chief Legal & Policy Officer, Polygon Labs today. Please find notes in CRM <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/4e31c9295f344ab1af32085bc62e7c9e?v=aa59b8b1375646b29f4d4c04e6dcbe6e&p=f7bd103069c24c419215b0358d6068c0&pm=s|here>.

tldr:
• Aligned with Polygon on MEV policy matters. Specifically, Rebecca has received multiple invitations for briefings on MEV from EU regulators, she has taken a few of them already (including one with the FCA for which Mikolaj joined her). She asked for help on her talking points and stressed a need for more content to educate policy makers who have a limited number of reliable public resources on MEV. 
• Polygon will join DOWG. She is excited about the prospect of the group and we identified a new workstreams to bring a few other informal working groups under its umbrella.

*Coinbase (Ventures)*

We spoke with the Jonathan from their ventures arm. They officially announced their 1M commitment in our fundraising early this week. Our call today was purely legal logistics and next steps. Notes <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Coinbase-Ventures-Flashbots-Series-B-c5875529779647dcabbee9e9461f6860|here>:

tldr:
• Excited to officially commit 1M
• MEVM and Hasu's updated pitch reopened a door that was previously closed
• Hasu, Bert, Alejo + others crushed a very long Q&A that sealed the deal
• No product or research related discussion occurred.

Brief notes from a Uniswap Foundation meeting earlier:
<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/UF-Flashbots-SBC-v2-85ca5f88fe944ecab7ae2c3c4d4aea20?pvs=4>

We agreed to:
• Offer a grant together for an MEV aware Uniswap frontend at ETHNY
• We follow up on UniX together, Ken will reach out to Labs to help navigate the politics
• Keep jamming on hooks and dex design, possibly with a hackathon in Turkey
I really like the idea of working together with them on frontends and using their distribution to get more people setting up our rpc/sending us tx flow with the settings we thinjk make sense

:pepe-cowboy: just made a major upgrade to our CRM stakeholder database, with the following exciting new features added:

• Linked it with the meeting note database bidirectionally so that you can easily find them from CRM database, and also one-click to add a new note
• Added an AI summary smart field that you can one click to generate an AI summary after writing the notes
• Also added a database automation so that after you finish typing the notes and generating the AI summary, the note page will automatically be posted in this channel for visibility!
See below screenshots and trial runs for more details and examples.

PS: :man-facepalming:forgot to turn off the automated notification after batch generation… probably a bit too many examples

There's a lot of context on the many partnerships like hashflow and 0x that I have explored based on my personal network, all non-urgent (they are not going anywhere, and very early, I would like to strategize a bit with <@U03FP0H62HH> today on the next steps, some needs us pitching first), all were related to additional ecosystem round.
Within the next 2 days, after I catch my breath and consolidate my notes with <@U05NYEHJUUW> in the CRM, I will make sure to give the other side the proper context and connect you and <@U05BMHJMRNK>. Would this work?

Ecosystem ownership it's primarily owned by me (with Jill) on a high level, <@U04QCPQ0CG5> was intro'd as a point person and he had met/ worked with Jill before flashbots. Jill and I are finding time to meet next week (cc. <@U05NYEHJUUW>)

More specifically, our touch points with espresso had been:
1. Collab on fundraising - they are putting in angel investments into Flashbots in our round
2. Potential collab on PBS guild - open ecosystem R&D map. 
3. PBS.day : Espresso presented their view on PBS for shared sequencing + responsive consensus (<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1avrxS5r7IEM2uLRSp5yr5w-Jyi8LSWQx/view?usp=drivesdk|slides> / <https://youtu.be/W4yp6WkPc5k?si=2pnoVaWKZWSPJfQn|recording>) - really really good stuff, suggest we check it out! 
4. Quintus presented at Espresso's shared sequencing workshop in a16z office (slides?)
:hourglass_flowing_sand: Pre ETHcc Paris and SBC they had asked to find time to jam with key folks on our research + suave teams to understand our collab (<@U03GKHM4G9Z> <@U03HT20PJES> <@U055KQHH3FZ> <@U05BMHJMRNK> + Bert + other SUAVE team folks ). However due to zero availability of key persons on our side, reshuffling of research eng and SUAVE team, reshuffling of L2 workstream, and shared sequencing not quite a org wide priority, we simply were unable to make time to meet with them for technical deep dives.

:arrow_right_hook: Going forward, I can follow up with them and set up the right point of contact - <@U03G4UY5NN9> for L2 PBS workstream and key folksfrom SUAVE? Given Ben's technical depth I think it would be a good idea for our senior researchers and product folks to do a deep dive with them to explore our collab.

<@U03PZSSETQA> cool, happy to follow up with <@U03G4UY5NN9> - let me know what is espressos priority in your book, I wonder if the BD reached out because of the espresso-optimism integration (I'm speculating only because I saw Mark Tyneway shared the integration link in the slack group chat recently)?

|   Some folks I’d be interested for us to connect with.

Building/searching
• Jump — Historically we’ve had some good jams with them on interesting features we could offer to searchers. Could be valuable to pick their brain on what their needs are right now and what they think of the builder market, alpha, etc.
• Jane street — Curious what the latest is after they shut down their builder due to regulation (IIRC) a few months back. Could have some insights on the reg landscape and just generally wonder what they’re up to now.
Protect/orderflow adoption
• Any and all asian wallets — If we can get a warm intro that leads to more conversation / adoption that’s a win. I’d particularly index on folks who are willing to engage with us and discuss their user needs, share ideas for new features we can build, etc, in addition to just selling them on eg. mev-share. A great outcome IMO would be a chance to have live calls with them after this event.
• Anchorage — After talking with Fireblocks I’d be curious what other custody providers’ needs are and if they’d want to use something like protect/mev-share :eyes: Seems like an interesting and under-explored part of the market, with a lot of capital, that skews towards blue chip / big tokens rather than meme coins (something we’ve been wanting to attract more of).
• If you happen to meet anyone who is involved in token launches — MEV-Share goes wild whenever there’s a big memecoin launch and I’d love to pill them to send to us.

|   “Paint point of acnhorage is info leaking from last transfers” — is the idea that they don’t want people to be able to tell which on chain vaults belong to which actor / to anchorage? So they’re trying to somewhat obfuscate the flow of funds?

Ultimately if it’s a public blockchain someone’s gonna be able to piece this together, though you could make it harder in some ways. We had a funky idea from tokenlon (IM token) to fund new wallets using the refunds from other wallets, which would be sort of like a mixer if there are enough refunds in that block.

Stepping out from the specifics though it sounds like “protection” is a key value prop for them which is fairly well aligned with what we can offer. I wonder how much this is about not leaking info in advance of trades and how much is just them not wanting identities of vaults and such to be known. The former is definitely up our alley.
|   Can you explain to me in simple words what exactly this means?

&gt; Adding settlement/clearinghouse functionality. E.g. they do escrow services for their clients, they allow them to trade on CEXs w/o custody risk, etc.
Would they ever make DEX trades? Or do anything on chain other than just transfers?
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 14/09/2023 10:04:18 Z:
|   They are working to add full on-chain trading, but they were a bit vague about that. I felt pretty convinced of it however. The notes should mention something like that
|   For the clearinghouse functionality, imagine Anchorage is a custodian. You hold all your funds there and you trust it. Now if you wanted to trade, they are looking to give you a way to do that but without your funds ever leaving the custody. Either because they execute the trade on Binance for you, or because they allow to match people within custody against each other. It sounded like a new settlement network on top of the custody network.

Sharing a v2 for DOWG update post.

Review would be appreciated, by EOD Tuesday next week is ideal!

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Decentralized-Operations-Working-Group-s-v2-eec9cc2f4bc54106b01dcbf5972ca356>

The substance of the update from v1 to v2:
• updated org name to Operations from Orderflow following feedback from counsel, external advisors, and key stakeholders including Coinbase. 
• removed OFA working group
• defined direction "_a forum to align industry efforts towards a decentralized future through research and development and best practices."_ 
• developed a clearer picture of what dowg has been and can be leveraging the fmp use case. This has resonated greatly in a few member pitches (most notably with Rebecca Rettig at Polygon), where I've been made aware of smaller groups looking for outlets to work on similar topics but unable to find the right balance between formality and participation. The feedback was positive on the working group structure. 
*Decentralized Operations Working Group (DOWG)*

_The Decentralized Operations Working Group (DOWG) is a forum to align industry efforts towards a decentralized future through research and development and best practices._

DOWG was established in April 2023 as the Decentralized Orderflow Working Group to set fair market principles for orderflow sharing between orderflow auctions (OFAs) and block builders. Today, most OFAs either share orderflow to multiple builders by default or give users the ability to share orderflow with selected block builders. The fair market principles remain the primary binding agent between block builders and OFAs to enable trusted orderflow sharing.

The creation of these principles was an important milestone. It demonstrated the industry’s ability to establish best practices where decentralized solutions are still being researched and developed.

More areas exist where industry can align efforts for market integrity, transparency, and fairness while on the road to a decentralized future. At EthCC Paris 2023 in July, DOWG members organized Orderflow.Salon to explore these areas and, as a result, established two new DOWG working groups on transparency and execution.

Some folks I’d be interested for us to connect with.

Building/searching
• Jump — Historically we’ve had some good jams with them on interesting features we could offer to searchers. Could be valuable to pick their brain on what their needs are right now and what they think of the builder market, alpha, etc.
• Jane street — Curious what the latest is after they shut down their builder due to regulation (IIRC) a few months back. Could have some insights on the reg landscape and just generally wonder what they’re up to now.
Protect/orderflow adoption
• Any and all asian wallets — If we can get a warm intro that leads to more conversation / adoption that’s a win. I’d particularly index on folks who are willing to engage with us and discuss their user needs, share ideas for new features we can build, etc, in addition to just selling them on eg. mev-share. A great outcome IMO would be a chance to have live calls with them after this event.
• Anchorage — After talking with Fireblocks I’d be curious what other custody providers’ needs are and if they’d want to use something like protect/mev-share :eyes: Seems like an interesting and under-explored part of the market, with a lot of capital, that skews towards blue chip / big tokens rather than meme coins (something we’ve been wanting to attract more of).
• If you happen to meet anyone who is involved in token launches — MEV-Share goes wild whenever there’s a big memecoin launch and I’d love to pill them to send to us.

DOWG related but not sure where to post: I just had a super awesome convo with <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Pulver|Jeff Pulver> who created VoIP and recounted some very relevant stories about how he navigated creating industry working groups and associations bc all the telecomms and multiple government agencies coming after him and his open source VoIP software. Said he would be very open to a chat with us. (Funny aside related to the DOWG renaming, he mentioned how he tried to help a blockchain working group who was forced to rename to Distributed Ledger Technology working group and then eventually just DLT working group which never "officially" stood for anything lol.)

|   Nice. Yeah <@U03FP0H62HH> in our ethCC demo they cited some ambiguity about roadmap focus between cross-chain and decentralization. Implying If decentralization is prio, shopping on suave would be high on list. 

<@U03TD87PTMK> can you tell us if they speak to their roadmap at all or does anyone know if talk is recorded?

Also can dmarz and I be added to the cowswap tg channel? <@U02CJ9QVAL9> if admin? Or maybe hasu?

Listened to Alex and Olgas (data?) talks from cowswap today (both on "The Blob"-stage). No mentions of their prioritization between decentralization vs multi-chain more than a generic "we are looking at other chains to deploy cowswap" during Olgas Q&A

I am very much Composable Cow-pilled though.

Product started jamming on Devconnect, and have some earlier asks (formal doc shortly) we’d love help on from <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U03TD87PTMK> <@U03GRQX5HGR>

1. Can we secure an official conference speaker slot for a Suave core member (for rigil launch)
2. are there already devconnect hackathons we can combine with?
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 13/09/2023 15:03:52 Z:
|   Sounds great, Kailin! Short answers logistically, yes and yes.

Note - there is no central conference this year but many big ones during the week. We can find the right audience and event. There will be a main hackathon from eth global and a bunch of others too that will be relevant.
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 14/09/2023 14:01:06 Z:

this is mainly for additional talks for relevant audiences ie: wallet event for suapps; programmable privacy event for mev-share; optimism event for suave x l2; etc. Rigil testnet launch we'll have a different workstream on.

|   Looks like dapp entrepreneur friend <http://parallel.fi|parallel.fi> already is moving to integrate with the natural app interface after our hotpot lol... <@U03G0PNEV0E> <@U05DY4WTLUB> <@U04MQRHLBPY> 

If you are an iOS user based on US, seriously suggest you to check out _Natural_ app to get a sense of good UX for future AI empowered intent based architecture haha (they are a tech company though so customer service is poor so don't buy anything physical there!) <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03PZSSETQA> 

All of us were blown away by the demo of _Natural_ superapp and their developer platform <http://imagica.ai|imagica.ai> (I think they have 15k beta testers and like 45k developers still in line waiting for early access) - I showed their stuff to Hayden, he was really impressed and I _think_ I heard a mumbling comment: "can we buy it..."  :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

|   <@U05BMHJMRNK> I can hook you up with Jerry Yue, and Yubo Ruan (<http://Parallel.fi|Parallel.fi>) if you have any ideas of how that may be applicable to our SUApps, don't wanna waste your time if it's too far away! I'm pretty sure Yubo is gonna build a superapp for swaps and nfts cross chain based on his new ai flavored website copy lol... 
Also curious to hear your thoughts on <http://imagica.ai|imagica.ai> if there's any potential with SUAVE given their "no code app interface" is pretty sick for webapps in web3! 
(Can probably get u on early access list!)

(<@U055KQHH3FZ> <@U03HT20PJES> <@U03G0PNEV0E> I don't know if my notes about use case that Luke and Felix discussed at 12:30am on our SBC spec BBQ night was accurate... correct me if I'm wrong there)

Blocknative very clearly doing proactive BD for their RPC -- *I fear that without a more focused BD effort for Protect with wallets over the next two months, we might not have much market left for adoption other than the large players.* Especially knowing that BN is not the only RPC doing BD, and that the market is becoming for saturated -- meanwhile we have a product differentiator with MEV-Share and we have the historical success of the lifetime of Protect (the new data from life time users and lifetime txs), where a very clear marketing campaign on why we are the time tested choice could resonate + the mev experts.

Bandwidth issue for executing on this exist across both product and ecosystem and Tina at the moment.

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 14/09/2023 16:45:36 Z:
|   Their RPC seems also surprisingly differentiated? With the better visibility/API feature
|   I would agree fwiw. The window for Protect is closing. If we don't make major progress this quarter, it will get much harder
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 14/09/2023 16:48:00 Z:
|   One thing that’s important to figure out about these integrations is if the wallets have integrated other RPCs by *default* or as an *opt in choice*

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 14/09/2023 17:01:13 Z:

|   Yeah was trying to figure out what <@U03FP0H62HH> was referring to by “better visibility feature” — is it this? <https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-mev-protection/transaction-boost#fetching-transactions-by-originid>
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 14/09/2023 17:09:09 Z:
|   Do I read that right that BN RPC could also be configured to send to MEv-Share -- so could outsource bd through them but then that could EAT Protect RPC flow and we wouldn't control the flow. So still need Protect RPC to win these bd races. <https://docs.blocknative.com/blocknative-mev-protection/transaction-boost>
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 14/09/2023 17:09:15 Z:
|   (that's what I meant but didn't look too deeply into it)
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 14/09/2023 17:11:09 Z:
|   I think roughly it: returns repsonse to wallet with how many builders responded success, and then also sends a msg when it lands onchain. Not really that crazy tbh... "Visibility API" == big marketing talk
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 14/09/2023 17:11:23 Z:
|   Yes they let you choose to send to mev-share <@U04QCPQ0CG5>
|   <@U05BMHJMRNK> why do people care about the builder responses :thinking_face:
|   Is this like “blocknative screwed up sending the tx to the builder” or is it dealing w the fact that each builder might have different error handling or something
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 14/09/2023 17:16:07 Z:
|   One of the concepts from Matt I really like is "transaction anxiety". user's just hit a button and metamask tells you "pending" but there's actually a lot more happening and it induces some anxiety where you don't know whats going on (so their first product gave u toast notifications saying "it was detected in 7 mempools". That was and still is popular with a few top Dapps but obvi private mempools broke that's usefulness.) I think this is an extension of that. Gives user some extra data: "6/7 of builders received your transaction and are processing".
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 14/09/2023 17:17:41 Z:
|   ^Consistent with a lot of other feedback, working on proposal for better protect ux/tracking page, agree
|   “Oh no where did my tx go what is happening”
|   Has the added benefit of exposing some education around the mev pipeline (need to avoid overwhelming people but could be done nicely)
|   In the limit would be sick if you could even see things like “X searchers have bid on your tx” or something
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 14/09/2023 17:21:19 Z:
|   Cowswap is best in class for showing you as a user what is happening to your txn
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 14/09/2023 17:22:45 Z:
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> do you think you could prioritize a basic visibility feature and what would a timeline be?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 14/09/2023 17:30:59 Z:
|   Yes, this is being scoped right now.

<@U04QCPQ0CG5> is right... can we get something on the calendar for tomorrow or monday on what we want to do and who is responsible to do it?
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 14/09/2023 17:42:39 Z:
|   tomorrow would work for me. I feel aligned on capacity and prioritization for ecosystem / coordination to talk it through with action items after.

we can flex some of my time and <@U05DY4WTLUB> to this. We have the <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/MEV-Share-Adoption-Tracking-71bd86efdf994e61b2bf6ec0a63700f8|tracker> already. Approach it with a takes a village mindset -- in the call can see what capacity y'all can flex and others (not sure if <@U03FP0H62HH> has any time to flex into it!).

quick ideas would be to look through tracker, identify 20 top targets (maybe spend top of the call deciding what is a top target, my suggestion would be mid-range wallets who will have quicker/lower integration barriers, I'm not sure its right to go after big fish, but the Uniswap and mevblocker anecdote does change this a bit, maybe you and Hasu and Tina can identify the big fish and hit them up?) and then action on outreach and engagement and address how flow would work -- wallet is interested, wallet talks to bd person (the person playing the bd role), wallet needs technical support (how to manage this), wallet integrates.
|   a bd/partnerships and a devrel hire solve this capacity gap for both outreach and for integration assistance -- we are lacking a customer acquisition and customer success team (to use corporate terms).
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 14/09/2023 17:50:47 Z:
|   (Sir customer success is not corporate:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: just enterprise startup term...) and I'm really going to sleep...
|   Just send over the list, I can rank them async over the weekend (the big fishes on the list may be in front of me for the next 36 hours... so)

Hold: Protect/MEV-Share BD

I had a call with Connor from Uniswap Wallet today. The full report here, which I recommend reading <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Shea-Connor-from-Uniswap-Wallet-7bc39b0b14f04064bc69c13838b3949e> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03GRQX5HGR>

Here’s a quick summary
• Uniswap Wallet is proceeding with an opt-in trial of MEVBlocker. It will be shipped in their next mobile release. They are not open to including Flashbots in this trial.
• They felt bad for neglecting to properly evaluate us as an option. This call was a courtesy / apology but it’s too late for anything to be changed.
• Despite this, we had a very interesting conversation about Uniswap Wallet as a product. I learned a lot about their priorities, values, and pain points.
• They care a lot about inclusion and execution, and take an opinionated stance to providing this to users. They want to abstract the complexity and provide the best swap experience.
• New kinds of custom tokens (eg feeOnTransfer) were a huge issue for them. They like the value prop of protected RPCs (privacy, reverts) — but I think the custom tokens made them care enough to actually integrate.
• One of the biggest challenge they face as wallet developers is managing nonces and choosing the right priority fees. Improving this experience is the single thing that could be compelling enough to encourage them to use Protect instead of MEVBlocker.
• I’m skeptical of doing any work for Uniswap without commitment on their end or validation that other wallets would benefit from it. That said, I enjoyed my conversation with Connor and think it’s worth exploring these ideas a bit further.

Had a super interesting market microstructure convo with <https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-zuehlke-507aa4110|Chris Zuehlek>, global head at Cumberland (big market maker) and a partner at DRW. More notes to come! 
Nerdsniped him on SUAVE, our Decentralized Orderflow Working Group - our random jam came up with some validation into SUAVE in the financial sector (the explanation of SUAVE as the coordination mechanism across the chaotic transaction supply chain seemed to work):
• Programmable privacy is needed in RFQs esp for block trades
• Transaction needs to control execution, decoupling the building stack is interesting
• SUAVE may be a more effective ISO

The global markets has a bunch of crypto people including Mary-Catherine from Uniswap.

And then obviously the digital asset subcommittee is all industry people. 

The more important CFTC industry function is called the Technical Advisory Committee, which paradigms Justin slaughter is on

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 19/09/2023 09:14:04 Z:
|   Chris is quite well suited for this, he was super articulate about tradfi market structure and what we are working on (mev, blockbuilding), much more than anyone I have encountered in the MEV space thus far. I am flagging him because I think he is exactly the type of expert we actually want to calibrate our market design work. He's an asset.

He didn't know you are at flashbots and this random connection blew both of minds just now ... Wow
Don't be surprised we may have some deep research collab with jump research! And Kanav is super familiar with SGX stack (also looked into derivadex which is sgx based)... he understands the technical bottle neck of nuanced trading usecases, so I will create a telegram group shortly.

We had a good jam with <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U05DY4WTLUB> on Protect + MEV-Share adoption following the above threads <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C04HSTQAK0S/p1694709789591969|Blocknative> + <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C04HSTQAK0S/p1694712030657419|execution responsibility>.

We aligned on the following:
1. we need to finalize a simple one-pager to share with partners and to circulate over social media
2. we need to conduct more proactive outreach to education potential partners and establish recurring touch points
One-Pager: We have a draft for the one-pager <https://www.notion.so/Protect-1-pager-for-wallets-84970e29748f4f10adf4e358086ba69c|here>, it will draw on some copy in my <https://x.com/0xYager/status/1701873392926761471?s=20|tweet thread>, and we hope to have a final draft for comment and design this week.

Outreach: We identified priority targets from our <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/MEV-Share-Adoption-Tracking-71bd86efdf994e61b2bf6ec0a63700f8|adoption target list>. You can view these by selecting the Outreach view. Next steps:
1. For many of these targets, we already have open communications with them on platforms like telegram. Over the course of this week, we are cross-referencing this list with those existing channels and following up with the targets there. When that outreach happens, we will then mark it down in the Stakeholders CRM as the last touch point (finalizing this process with <@U05DY4WTLUB> later today and will have another message on it). 
2. Once we complete step one, we will identify the remaining targets and make a post in this channel to identify who internally has connections and can facilitate an intro
3. Once all targets are in communication channels, we will draft a process to ensuring we have regular touch points with them to keep Protect + MEV-Share front of mind 
_From outreach that has taken place, we have learned that wallets and apps are not likely to make quick decisions. It is instead about education and recurring touch points and integration assistance._

|   On it. Check in weekly with the targets for orderflow acquisition. Currently have Trust Wallet and OKX Wallet in the process of integrating. OKX Wallet finished implementing and hasn’t started testing. They are running it on test net. Trust wallet still implementing. Ongoing conversation with Zerion as they were not sure if the benefit of MEV redistribution is worth their effort…

I can set up a periodic, like weekly briefing to some Slack channel!

Protect Outreach: *Action Request -- please look at all the targets below and help us identify points of contact, contact information and if a telegram channel already exists. ~Struck text~ refers to answer provided in replies.* 

_This type of exercise is a big part of improving our internal knowledge management and making sure our CRM has updated info. The targets below are only the ones we are missing info from, not all the targets. Follow along in the <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/MEV-Share-Adoption-Tracking-71bd86efdf994e61b2bf6ec0a63700f8#4de4eb35cf4b4582b89e21261add001c|Outreach> tab of the MEV-Share Adoption Tracker (part of the stakeholder CRM)._ 

~*0x / Matcha*~ -- no contact listed, no telegram listed. Who is best PoC, do we have a telegram? <@U03PZSSETQA> + <@U05578MHMUZ>

~*Alpha Wallet*~ -- we have an email for CEO Victor Zhang. No telegram group set up. Do we have any soft connections here? <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U05DY4WTLUB>

*<http://Blockchain.com|Blockchain.com>* -- PoC is Jacob who is interviewing, would need a new PoC if/when he leaves. Currently notes say <@U03PZSSETQA> mainly dm'ing Jacob but no telegram group that is just Flashbots-Blockchain (there seems to be one with coinbase+us+blockchain, not sure if thats just viktor)

~*Blowfish*~ -- no PoC, contact, or Telegram in tracker, I added Fabio at a PoC but we still need his telegram. Do we have a group TG with them already? <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U03GRQX5HGR>

*Brave Wallet* -- PoC we have right now is on marketing team, asking for intro to wallet team.

~*Rabby Wallet*~ -- No PoC, no contact, no telegram.

*Edge Wallet* -- PoC is CEO, but not channel established. I believe I can get an intro, advise if anyone else knows them!

*Floor* -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram

*Gem* -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram

*Opera Wallet* -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram

~*Math Wallet*~ -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram (integrated Blocknative but still worth reaching out) <@U03GRQX5HGR>

*Moon Pay* -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram

~*Token Pocket*~ -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram

~*Zerion*~ -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram

~*Anchorage*~ -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram in the tracker, but I know <@U03FP0H62HH> has chatted with them and <@U03PZSSETQA> is aware of them -- can y'all inform if there is a telegram and PoC/contact.

~*OKX Wallet*~ -- no PoC, no contact, no telegram in the tracker, but I know <@U03FP0H62HH> has chatted with them for fundraise, could we get an intro to their wallet team?

*Eden* -- I am only in the IR telegram, is there another one with Eden for other things?

<@U02CJ9QVAL9> I think you’d mentioned potentially going to someone higher up at uniswap about the failure to include Protect in their new swap protection feature. Quick thought on what the most tractable path could be.

What uniswap cares about
1. They do not want to do extra dev work
2. They _really_ do not want to have 2 options in the UI
3. I also expect they’d much rather make a backend change than a client change. iOS releases not fun.
Suggestion: Update their backend to split txs between mevblocker and protect.
• No client changes
• Still a single choice in UI
• Keeps them more neutral
• Redundancy and backup in case of a failure in either
It’s still gonna take a bit of work, but this seems like the lowest lift thing. If we were to propose something.

|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 22/09/2023 21:05:26 Z:
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> sounds good, in the absence of that I think Connor was clear to me that he would be willing to switch if we could offer a reason to (eg better visibility, better nonce management). I think he was serious about it.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 22/09/2023 21:51:32 Z:
|   Yep that was my takeaway from our call. Posting this in the event we intend to push without that in hand.

eth global submisions due in an hour, who else is around to judge? :slightly_smiling_face: Based on the discord activity not expecting a ton of submissions
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 24/09/2023 13:46:21 Z:
|   <@U05BMHJMRNK> I'm around to help with remote judging or share with you how I did the judging last time (or typically how ethglobal judging works).
Last time I suspect we got a bunch of submissions despite we entered as a sponsor in the last 24hr, for the following reasons (based on the folks who answered my questions)
• we shared our challenges + bounties in the ethglobal ny main discord chat, 
• ethglobal retweeted our tweets on prizes, 
• A bunch of folks went to the workshop Shea physically presented, and ethglobal retweeted the workshop Livestream links
• A bunch of folks knew about it through our EthCC MEV Salon
• Mike and Jake were physically going around and talking to hackers live about we have prizes 
Not following closely what we did to increase engagement with the hackers attending this time, it would be a good data point to know what the submission rate, for future reference!
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 24/09/2023 15:07:57 Z:
|   we got 8 submissions! pretty solid
|   question re : uniswap partnership, we have some uniswap submissions but they're okay and probably wouldnt make my top 3. Should we still pick one of those bc collab w/ Uniswap? Feels like we didnt really collab with them much on the challenge <@U03GRQX5HGR>

|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 24/09/2023 15:15:50 Z:
|   I assume so, cuz this is a prize they also give out half the prize right?

I was chatting with someone yesterday that is an investor in <https://www.swaap.finance/team|Swaap> -- they are a defi market maker with a big focus on <https://www.swaap.finance/research|research>, the team is more from tech/consulting than crypto native. Two things to pass along -- they are busy working on 1inch Fusion and Cowswap integrations to become solvers. But they don't want to keep the solver profits for themselves, they are trying to build secondary pools (yield faming on solver fees) where they can inject the fees for some additional mechanism (not too sure how it is supposed to work).

I'll make a CRM entry. Could be a target for RPC integration for solvers. <https://twitter.com/swaapfinance?lang=en>

We have channels with a ton, and many more had come to our researchathons and events. Trying to figure out which ones you prefer - do you want big ones by market share? or by type of designs? Or by MEV literacy? Or by relationship with us?

1. Hashflow <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Varun-Tina-Angela-Danning-e13f9efe205f418283f49101f159c0ab?pvs=4|meeting notes>, embedded in
2. Hashflow <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Hashflow-5dacb6b956934e1b80062299436dc730?pvs=4|CRM profile page>, including its product roadmap, market share, social graph etc.
*Readout on Hashflow notes - SUAVE relevant part* <@U03QCGC3SL9> <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
• Hashflow get routed [2-3%] of Ethereum swaps orderflow, integrated with major dex and aggregators and account for significant volume on Cowswap (see CRM profile page) 
• It's founder Varun is exploring an offchain orderbook design at the moment, primarily for performance, UX and decentralized custody, to tap into a bigger CeFi exchange space. 
• When we first spoke during SBC, Varun was interested in any offchain orderbook. 
• Recently at Token2049, Varun surveyed existing ZK solution space, and learned about <http://Brine.fi|Brine.fi> (a Starkware CLOB). 
• Now seems to be favoring ZK solutions for offchain orderbook- in particular RiscZero/Celestia stack. 
• However, Varun has not tested the feasibility yet, so if CLOB on SUAVE is a potential solution, Hashflow can be a smart partner to prototype with. 
The notes also cover Hashflow's view on orderflow microstructure <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03HT20PJES> 
• Suspected 1 inch dynamic fee discrimination
• How will orderflow landscape evolve
• Hashflow's plan to charge a dynamic fee after October, adding front end, and plan for integration with UniswapX via a solver 
<@U03FP0H62HH> you have a fundraising pitch with Hashflow, to be scheduled on Tuesday or Thursday. Hope this is a starting point ;)

> Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 28/09/2023 01:07:29 Z:
I met with Hayden earlier to talk Protect and X/SUAVE. Condensing a lot into a few bullet points:
1. *Regret Over mevblocker*: Uniswap's decision to choose mevblocker over Protect is something they regret and apologized for quite a bit; they chose it because they experienced Protect being slow long ago and didn't know we shared orderflow. The wallet is about 1% of webapp frontend volume.
2. *Priority on Speed*: Uniswap values speed a lot. They are optimizing down to the millisecond, reflecting the demands of their users and competition from telegram bots.
3. *Open to derisking*: Hayden understances that we are hesitant to do much to collaborate with Uniswap without a clear commitment; however, Hayden and the wallet decision-maker Conner are open to derisking this by committing to adopt Protect if we built a feature that they would find valuable.
4. *Future Collaborations*: My discussions around UniswapX suggest a slow integration and migration process and low probability of serious investment from their team.
5. *SUAVE Strategic Direction*: Given the above, it makes more sense to me to focus on competing and smaller entities, like cowswap or matcha. Another angle is to leverage the Uniswap Foundation's desire to differentiate and pressure Labs to influence Labs.

Flagging <@U05NYEHJUUW> as internal knowledge management MVP is the priority project assigned to you (cc. <@U04QCPQ0CG5> <@U05DY4WTLUB> ): Robert's notes page is linked to Uniswap entry in CRM, but the current CRM main page of Uniswap can use some love.

I understand that there has been a meeting to do an internal knowledge management revamp sprint next week, but can we pick a few key accounts such as Uniswap entry as a prototype for multi-org accounts this week before a sprint next week and the in-person session during Offslack?

George, Reid, and I had an extended working session to build out and clean up bi-directional databases for Stakeholder Notes, External Contacts, and Tasks that can be applied to all CRM entries. Your feedback is encouraged and appreciated.

We'll eventually update all entries, so that overall this is a much more robust and useful tool.

We have an official small group session on the books for *CRM Updating & Training* at OffSlack to do just that.

|   <@U05NYEHJUUW> amazing work, thank you team! A couple minor asks:
1. for the actual notes page, can we have a few templates pre-populated? this way it makes the actual note taking easier...
2. for each of the CRM entry, I would suggest to have a profile page (my <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Hashflow-5dacb6b956934e1b80062299436dc730|Hashflow entry> is a poorly written example but you get the gist of it) either as notes, or as part of the main entry page
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 04/10/2023 13:35:02 Z:
|   The layout is a little different than before, where the items (meetings, contacts, etc) that used to be in the template part are now part of the upper section. We still do a template especially to add the background info you mention with the Hashflow entry.

Cross-posting for visibility. Is there synergy between Blocknative's private RPC aggregator `Transaction Boost` and Flashbots Protect or SUAVE? <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03QCGC3SL9>
<https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C03FFJ38GMC/p1696275804525949?thread_ts=1695642886.275299&cid=C03FFJ38GMC>
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 02/10/2023 20:59:49 Z:
|   The synergy is basically them being an aggregator that sends to us. Which, coincidentally, is a strategy we are considering pursuing ourselves.

That’s what comes to mind at first glance for me!
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 02/10/2023 21:29:20 Z:
|   • they lose the tx trail once it's sent to builders, I don't know where else the product could go... unless they're integrating with builders as well? or they're just adding a UI onto it to make it look nicer
• i agree we should empower other aggregators and RPCs, but blocknative scares me ... feels like relay take 2 they will want to extract money on the OF 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 02/10/2023 21:29:56 Z:
|   Yeah I don’t clearly see an action we would take here
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 02/10/2023 21:36:18 Z:
|   i think they are trying to make data observability their selling point, and their focus at the moment is mempool data. Matt seems to hint at they are not in the short term interested in builder and relay data. They are trying to compete with Etherscan, but for mempool data

*Re: Hashflow*
1. Hashflow <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Varun-Tina-Angela-Danning-e13f9efe205f418283f49101f159c0ab?pvs=4|meeting notes>, embedded in
2. Hashflow <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Hashflow-5dacb6b956934e1b80062299436dc730?pvs=4|CRM profile page>, including its product roadmap, market share, social graph etc.
*Readout on Hashflow notes - SUAVE relevant part* <@U03QCGC3SL9> <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
• Hashflow get routed [2-3%] of Ethereum swaps orderflow, integrated with major dex and aggregators and account for significant volume on Cowswap (see CRM profile page) 
• It's founder Varun is exploring an offchain orderbook design at the moment, primarily for performance, UX and decentralized custody, to tap into a bigger CeFi exchange space. 
• When we first spoke during SBC, Varun was interested in any offchain orderbook. 
• Recently at Token2049, Varun surveyed existing ZK solution space, and learned about <http://Brine.fi|Brine.fi> (a Starkware CLOB). 
• Now seems to be favoring ZK solutions for offchain orderbook- in particular RiscZero/Celestia stack. 
• However, Varun has not tested the feasibility yet, so if CLOB on SUAVE is a potential solution, Hashflow can be a smart partner to prototype with. 
The notes also cover Hashflow's view on orderflow microstructure <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03HT20PJES> 
• Suspected 1 inch dynamic fee discrimination
• How will orderflow landscape evolve
• Hashflow's plan to charge a dynamic fee after October, adding front end, and plan for integration with UniswapX via a solver 
<@U03FP0H62HH> you have a fundraising pitch with Hashflow, to be scheduled on Tuesday or Thursday. Hope this is a starting point ;)

Hey <@U03GRQX5HGR> / <@U04QCPQ0CG5>,

Dmarz and I have been jamming further on the DevConnect hackathon game-plan.

We’d like to request support from Coordination to help us document discussions and take detailed notes during several ~10-minute rapid-fire Suave “use-case” conversations we want to have at the hack. (These should be more informed given docs will be live, Rigil will be launched, etc).

We’re envisioning converting these insights into a paper that informs Suave roadmap and adoption strategy going forward.

Do you think there will be internal resources on the ground who can assist w/ this kind of note-taking? If everyone will be tied up, do you think we can find external support?
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 03/10/2023 04:14:30 Z:
|   I would recommend adopting something like: <https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Charging-Microphone-Cancellation-Interview/dp/B09GYD55JF>
|   pass the mic around to capture the conversation, have AI do the transcription, and then post-process the transcript later
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 03/10/2023 10:21:37 Z:
|   Is this for the eth global hackathon or for something smaller with high value targets ahead of time? I would ask for most of the devconnect planning and jamming to be shared in open channels so we can all stay on the same page and also be sure to loop fred and I in more directly so we can do this planning together!

For the note taking request, I'd like to break this trend of asking support of 'coordination' and get closer and closer to removing the idea from the org of 'coordination' all together as a temp firm that can be contracted for services.

The current request process like this devalues our team members as just clerks for product or research and creates a trend of lack of ownership from those facilitating the requests to first look to themselves to fill the need (for example at Eth denver, Shea and Angela did a bunch of interviews and took great notes and when Shea needed a break she asked someone else to takeover).

We should just be planning this event / activity all together and if we identify a need for a note taker then we can see how best to execute on it.

|   The 2025 deadline to decentralize infra is a pretty convenient tail wind for us. Also interesting to hear they're exploring a rollup too. I have suspected thats the way UniX is going and that it might be a bigger trend.

• Cowswap’s main motivation for Suave is decentralization. Euro regulators to require KYC for centralized solutions in 2025. No-go for Cowswap.
• First *CoWSUAVE* PoC => decentralize their backend, which includes orderbook / solver’ quote APIs and messaging layer.
• Then, PoC for CoWSUAVE on L2s! <@U02CJ9QVAL9>’s vision: “Imagine you can deploy CoWSUAVE once and they benefit from new domains that are integrated to SUAVE indefinitely”
• They inquired about incentives and Suave economics. It’s a significant change for their entire backend to be hosted on Suave.
*Next steps:*
• Cowswap wants decentralization roadmap clarity by *end of November!* :hot_face: 
• Anna will jam with Hasu as on incentives, and Kailin for integration logistics, *calls to be booked week after Offslack!*

|   SUAVE economics was what Martin Koppelman drilled us on when we met with him in Berlin in August, the context was partially what he believes at the core of Cowswap on SUAVE. Martin's view was they think about it as a non-trivial investment from Cowswap and Gnosis ecosystem perspective. He prolly asked us 3 times in that single meeting whether SUAVE has a token, and whether SUAVE has plans to charge applications or extract fees lol (Cc. <@U03HT20PJES> <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U055KQHH3FZ> )
My response was our party line from fundraising pitches - co-designing the economics with the applications and mechanism designers like himself. 
I shared the tldr with <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> back then, can dig up the notes.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 04/10/2023 16:56:04 Z:
|   <@U03FP0H62HH> be careful about incentivization, I suspect every app is looking to partner with an L2 for massive joint incentive plans with their tokens.

(This has been a consistent takeaway with my market insights from every OF originator that operate on L2s, applications, wallets, of which the focus of most had been on L2 partnerships, even with <http://rabbithole.gg|rabbithole.gg> whom I had the catch up chat yesterday - their main revenue source had been from L2s spraying tokens (for no good purpose other than one-up each other for 5min of leaderboard fame).
I suspect incentivization route in near term we are not gonna have any advantage.

Note to internal knowledgebase project team <@U05NYEHJUUW> <@U05DY4WTLUB> (cc. <@U04QCPQ0CG5>): 

as we embark on rebuilding internal knowledge base, here is a table summarizing all of the _hundreds_ of fragmented partnership entries in 4 CRMs we have through our different programs from Research, Product, Coordination... (disclaimer: this table doesn't include our hundreds more telegram/discord/slack channels) and may be already outdated as we create new connections daily lol...) something to think about when we create new telegram groups, new entries, and constructing new CRM databases.

We need a protocol of updating our internal knowldege base ;) creating standard templates based on pattern seeking across existing entries + establishing relationships between different leads, two steps already started, imo are key to consolidating knowldege and focusing our internal mindshare. 

If we want to preserve the degree of freedom in spontaneous individual outreach, while also having the benefit of building on what we know about each partnership from other angles + execution followups, having a scalable way to crowd source the updates in CRM entry is key.

We talked with Dan and Noam from Alchemy today about what’s on the horizon for 4337. CRM notes <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/4337-bundler-chat-14a606423fe44735bab45b07127c31d9|here>, quick summary below.
• 4337 adoption is still fairly small and early, but growing at a decent rate.
• The p2p mempool for userOps is being developed and might make it to L1/L2 in Q1.
• Asks and collabs
    ◦ Alchemy wants protected RPCs to accept 4337 userOps (we said we’ll do this when there is sufficient 4337 orderflow)
    ◦ Merge OS rundler into OS rust builder (agreed to collab in Q4)
    ◦ We’re both interested in PBS on L2s — it’s needed for 4337 bundler-builder vision to work (<@U03G4UY5NN9>are any of our early POCs on this public?)
    ◦ Alchemy wants to make MEV dashboards for L2 userOps (we suggested leveraging the community)

I recently got connected to <https://cyberconnect.me/|CyberConnect> team's founders
• both chinese - Zhimao, Ryan - they been building in crypto since 2017 and pretty OG and doesnt seem to be the 割韭菜 type of crypto ppl. They also built other projects before (<https://link3.to/|link3>, another live platform bought by Tron's Sun lol). They are based in Bay Area. 
• They are building a 4337 account abstraction wallet, and has some pretty good adoption, working with a bunch of known projects in the space too (mentioned a bunch data projects that i know). 
• They are very interested in participating as a suave app and would love to connect to understand how they can build with suave integration - <@U03GRQX5HGR> What do you think? Shall we have a TG group set up first, or shall we assess further before connecting?
let me know how to facilitate!

They had an AA collab with ZeroDev, whose AA account solution they used.

Building wallet can be a natural move for them as they already have many users. Would be interesting to see what they want to build!

    ◦ Elias as a PBS Foundation Grants Council candidate
    ◦ Elias as a PBS Foundation community contributor, contributing to 3 areas
        ▪︎ Help design process and conduct technical due diligence of relays
        ▪︎ Help set up sub-committee on Relays: design criteria and review relay applications
        ▪︎ Scope out Data Transparency mandates, write RFPs
    ◦ Rated as a potential applicant for PBS Foundation

What's their track record on the particular things they mentioned they could do?

I.e. have they already designed standards? Monitoring performance? Creating processes and committees with the right agenda and scope and impact?

My impression was that they're mostly capable/experienced around data.
|   On Rated X Suave Centauri -- we could start jamming on it with them. Probably will be easier once our testnet is public, but there might still be topics for them to explore before (and using out local devnet that's already working)

:memo: *[Notes] Oct 17: Tina/Simon Brown (Consensys Strategy)*
_Note: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Simon-Brown-Tina-be909de7864c4e1e8ed226a7736dc3f2|meeting notes with action items>_ _filed in the Stakeholder CRM._ 

*Context:*
I scheduled this meeting to catch up with Simon Brown primarily for PBS Foundation, but it turned into a chat about SMG acquisition and OFA.
*Readout:*
• Consensys acquisition of SMG and its implications for Flashbots. <@U03HT20PJES> <@U03FP0H62HH> 
    ◦ SMG is acquired for expertise in mechanism design, not its product, and will remain as a consulting group for mechanism design and MEV within Consensys. 
    ◦ Speculation about Consensys enshrining a default RPC that makes it hard for users to switch is considered far-fetched. There may be an equivalent of OFA for Metamask, but it won't be a straightforward adoption of Rook's design. <@U03PZSSETQA> 
    ◦ SMG will play a role in connecting with Flashbots and can be the interface between Consensys and Flashbots on SUAVE. <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
• Simon found <http://orderflow.pics|orderflow.pics> interesting, immediately noticed the different classes of solvers and resolvers, but surprised SCP shows up larger than Airswap in Metamask sankey. <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U05578MHMUZ> 
• Consensys has committed to donating $100,000 to the PBS Foundation.
• Linea team has decided to work on their own decentralized sequencer design. <@U03G4UY5NN9> 
• SMG is getting to know Linea team’s design to provide them with design advice.
• Simon Brown's paper <https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1493|Measuring the concentration of control in contemporary Ethereum> has been published on Cryptography ePrint Archive, asking for our help for Arxiv ref. <@U03UY83AGUQ>

• Jacob will speak with his team to understand broader how they feel about everything. He will write this up more concretely with exactly which pieces EG feels could fit into and which pieces they could support on.
    ◦ The aim is for this to be done early next week
• I'll be scheduling another call to follow up, likely next Friday, given schedules

Do we have a connection with aave?

|   Apparently they use our RPC for free read-only requests. Curious if we could get them to send write requests through it too
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 20/10/2023 02:32:42 Z:
|   Sure, can ask. I remember we have a telegram group. Btw, would love an update on protect strategy. Do we want to continue with the adoption push pre-offslack?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 20/10/2023 18:14:46 Z:
|   Thanks! Lmk

On product strategy — consensus right now is to focus on 2 things for protect
1. UX improvements — eg. ship a nice landing page
2. Adoption — if coordination has bandwidth it would be great to continue our wallet conversations/BD to convert more people to the RPC
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 20/10/2023 18:15:54 Z:
|   For 2,  we want both read and write requests?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 20/10/2023 18:38:53 Z:
|   Yeah in general, when we say “RPC adoption” we’re talking about getting the write requests (orderflow)
|   For aave specifically it seems like they’re freeloading off our RPC for read requests but not actually sending us orderflow (writes) lol
|   But since they already have it partially integrated, wonder if we could get in the door to get orderflow too
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 22/10/2023 21:33:52 Z:
|   Sounds good, will follow up with Stani to set up a group to follow up.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 23/10/2023 18:11:53 Z:
|   Ok so they use pokt, which apparently sends to protect? Is that true?

<@U03H6U5F200> and I <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/UMA-oracle-use-case-x-MEV-Share-3f32424dbc5a40b6b994e27a3b2379d5|talked with UMA >earlier today about their new oracle protocol. It’s pretty cool!

What is UMA and what is its value prop
• UMA is a wrapper around oracles. Defi protocols can use it to create their own “wrapped oracle” which has 2 benefits.
• First, you can use UMA to combine _multiple_ oracles together! This makes updates faster and more reliable
• Second, the defi protocol can _capture their own MEV_! Because the wrapped oracle updates are sent through MEV-share
How does the MEV-Share integration work
• Whitelisted actors submit wrapped updates to MEV-Share
• The defi protocol is set as the refund recipient
• If the update is backrun in a certain window, then the defi protocol captures the refund
• Otherwise, they’ll land a normal (not wrapped) update
What’s still needed to implement this
• UMA wants the wrapped updates to only land if they are backrun
• Option 1: They set priority fee to 0 on these txs. We update our systems to not land 0 prio fee txs.
• Option 2: Let users specify a “minimum refund” on their txs. We don’t land txs unless they receive >= this refund.
Extrapolating a bit — We’ve been wondering how to extend the benefits of redistribution to applications. This is an interesting approach. UMA folks think it’s also relevant to other use cases like NFT mints. We’ll probably ship option 1 this month if resources permit.

On Wednesday, I met with Ray and Didier from Consensys to do a retro on our fundraise and discuss their acquisition of SMG.

(AI) summary:
• The meeting with Consensys discussed the acquisition of SMG, a team with expertise in MEV. SMG will remain a separate brand and not be entirely absorbed into Consensys. 
• The possibility of Metamask using SMG's OFA is being explored, but no commitment has been made. 
• The discussion also touched on the potential collaboration between SMG and Flashbots, with Consensys open to ideas. 
• Metamask's future strategy includes focusing on intent-based infrastructure and account abstraction, with a particular interest in Metamask Snaps, aiming to become a decentralized app store. 
• The meeting concluded with Consensys expressing openness for further discussions.
The convo was very open and interesting -- worth reading in its entirety

*Potential Key Partner Update:* 
_Yesterday, Angela and I had an exploratory meeting  with CEO of Tokka Labs (spun out of Altonomy) through my friend Leo Zhang's intro. We primarily discussed insights around orderflow market structure evolution, what are the pain points of market makers, which were insightful for SUAVE and painpoints for orderflow stack. This is not to say we need to immediately prioritize these needs, but IMO it validates that searchers and market makers need programable privacy (more so than users), and that IMO access to cheap geo distributed liquidity for defi market makers, and node running in an enclave as a service may be good applications or services on top of SUAVE._
• Tokka Labs, formed by ex-Altonomy members after Altonomy sold its OTC desk to <http://Blockchain.com|Blockchain.com>, is currently involved in RFQ market making, UniswapX and 1Inch Fusion, some arbitrage activities, and block building across the transaction supply chain. They are hungry, smart, agile, open to sharing, aligned with more competition and permissionless market making. 
• They integrated with MEV-Share within the 1st 2 weeks of our launch, and their pain points seem to be very SUAVE aligned. We have a MEV-Share group with them before, but it seems that we can prioritize them as a key player in the market that can provide more strategic insights and a thought partner on SUAVE use case.
• Their pain points are lack of quality data around execution, and mitigation around counterparty risks. 
• Tokka Labs is focusing on cross-chain trading, and intent-based systems in the future, bullish on the rise of specialized offchain executors like solvers, fillers and resolvers, because they can better fulfill intents, and give the orderflow gating dapp protocols more control.
• They sees potential for collaboration on privacy and guarantees in intent-based systems like SUAVE. Privacy and trust guarantees are considered important for market makers. They also sees emerging opportunities for cheap capital provision to market makers and searchers (as a credible service).

|   thanks, checked notes quickly. imo another validation that we shall builder Protect Explorer which we wanted to build for data offsite hackathon..

and agree that it always should have been the way we talk to potential integrator: with data metrics to show, and develop monitoring tools for them to check performance, etc.

|   I found <https://flashbots-explorer.marto.lol|this> a long time ago and amazed it still works… you can search for any flashbots landed bundles by block number, but not by tx_hash yet. Maybe we can get in touch with the author to see if he can build it in
|   
|   > Elaine [U03N9H4JP8C] @ 30/10/2023 17:38:44 Z:
|   just to add, our protect tx is already in this explorer, so it should be an easy thing to add search by tx_hash

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 30/10/2023 18:07:15 Z:
|   What is “Protect Explorer”?
|   
|   > Elaine [U03N9H4JP8C] @ 30/10/2023 20:26:06 Z:
|   it’s a hackathon idea we had at the data offsite. Basically an explorer where you could input a user tx hash and it shows details of time it took to land, builders it was sent to, fees paid, refunds received etc. to help user understand the execution of the tx
|   
|   > danning [U05578MHMUZ] @ 30/10/2023 20:39:21 Z:
|   and it can expands to allowing searcher to input their signing keys to see all bundles' status (landed, or reverted etc)
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 30/10/2023 21:50:19 Z:
|   Ah we’re thinking along somewhat similar lines here with the spec for the protect dashboard!

We’re more focused on actionable status info for pending txs (vs historica data) at first, but probably will expand over time to include the latter

[CONFIDENTIAL] Update on Hashflow
As a follow up of our previous <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C04HSTQAK0S/p1696288645322999?thread_ts=1695845659.097639&cid=C04HSTQAK0S|convo>, <@U03G0PNEV0E> and I met up with Varun from Hashflow today:
• Hashflow protocol is turning on dynamic fee switch tomorrow, which will be interesting to see how much they can make. 
• Hashflow is planning on launching a shitcoin perp next (Tokka / Altonomy also mentioned) on RISC-V stack, using <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C04HSTQAK0S/p1696288645322999?thread_ts=1695845659.097639&cid=C04HSTQAK0S|risc0> x Celestia (also considering EigenDA)
    ◦ Why risc0 instead of Starkware: UX advantage withdraw within 20min instead of 9 hours
    ◦ He's interested in learning more about SUAVE (waiting to schedule with <@U03FP0H62HH>), his main pain points are counterparty risk (not necessarily decentralized custody) - e.g. FTX wouldn't happen if this risk is not removed. 
    ◦ Why perps? 
        ▪︎ Perp is doing $100mn per day spread across 3 CeFi exchanges
        ▪︎ Decentralized perp dydx is king but they are on cosmos
        ▪︎ FTX collapse provided a great market opportunity for shitcoin persp. No one is focused on the long tail perps these days (possibly reg concerns)
        ▪︎ Hashflow has competitive advantage as perps are more institutional than retail, and it also has 50 (or 15?) market makers (pmms) which is important for perp liquidity
    ◦ Likely doing it as a separate entity from their HFT DAO.
_Notes from Tina: perp is a hot market unique to crypto (bitmex pioneered it) - from my experience helping design McDEX (a perp dex with amm), perps challenge has always been market making and risk management (Lev/scp was the few parties who can market make it well back then), more institutional than retail market. Pain points is regulatory, and counterparty risk. Can be interesting SUAVE usecase, offchain CLOB can be a good use case for SUAVE Andromeda later on, worth exploring. Curious <@U03FP0H62HH>'s thoughts_

Had a great chat with <https://x.com/0x94305?t=zbZi66JJc4-MovlsRF3KGQ&s=09|Alex Nezlobin>, he is currently working on a stealth mode project auctioning off signals to MEV supply chain participants, built on Uniswap v4 hooks, potentially launching with Uni v4 during DenCun. 
• Alex is interested in learning more and experimenting on SUAVE, as he is planning to run the offchain infra in a centralized manner, and is regulatory aware. <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03HT20PJES>

Yolo hang out with Hayden 2 days ago, I invited <@U03G0PNEV0E> as well who can share more. My key takeaways (those I remember...)
1. Uniswap just had their onsite in NYC where the highlight was their internal hackathon, where they shipped a lot of things they can actually incorporate into their roadmap, including cross chain swaps using their existing network of offchain fillers, and limit orders on UniswapX, amongst many others.
2. We chatted a bit about our frustration around All Hands, and how Uniswap improved their all hands thats now kinda dope. Here's my takeaways (curious <@U05NYEHJUUW>'s take on it)
    a. They stopped doing regular team updates
    b. They now have brief strategic content shared by the leadership - Hayden & MC usually (priorities, key updates, announcements, etc)
    c. The rest of the all hands is basically the most interesting and important content (similar to our show and tell).
    d. They run All Hands weekly on Thursday. Every month on All Hands they do a leadership AMA, but not anonymous, because they believe those who ask questions should feel open to speak their mind or ask their questions, or else it's asymmetric treatments, and that workplace is a high trust environment.
    e. They often end All Hands early instead of using up full 60min.
3. We chatted about the lack of real world usecase for crypto applications, and his recent thesis that convinced a bunch of trad people was "vampire attack on web2 applications"
4. He's excited about AI applications and suave. 
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 03/11/2023 17:24:18 Z:
|   where to read about the thesis :eyes: it is kinda one of the OG “Web3” thesis right?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 03/11/2023 17:42:21 Z:
|   nothing written... It's in a vibes space lol
|   
|   > Chelsea A. Peterson [U05NYEHJUUW] @ 06/11/2023 14:56:30 Z:
|   Overall, everyone really liked the above changes to All Hands, with the exception of "Every month on All Hands they do a leadership AMA, but not anonymous, because they believe those who ask questions should feel open to speak their mind or ask their questions, or else it's asymmetric treatments, and that workplace is a high trust environment."

There was a LOT of feedback on this choice, basically with folks saying that this allows leadership to not have to answer the spicy questions people have. And empirically, that's what happened - in making it not-anonymous, there were far fewer critical questions that were asked of the executive team.

I can attest that Uniswap is a fairly open, high trust environment. However, as someone who has worked alongside high level leadership for a majority of my career, people often do not feel comfortable asking difficult questions of those in leadership positions, either for fear of negative retribution or simply for fear of leadership in and of itself. The position of power, no matter how flat an organization, can be intimidating, especially when wanting information that may be controversial.

Met one of the founders of Swaap today. They basically offer a service "give us your money and we will actively market make for you with our bespoke strategies in DeFi". Their selling point is that they use smart contracts +  oracles to give their LPs better guarantees. Their biggest problem right now is that this is gas intensive. He was interested in SUAVE as a means to provide guarantees while saving on gas and requested a follow up.

They're kind of similar to vault-based products like yearn and sommelier (from my understanding). I'm wondering if we've been overlooking a category of potential users

Had a funny <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Intro-chat-with-degatchi-39dcf76e8c5d499c8100b88db7343e0c|conversation> with degatchi today. Couple dots
• Used to work with titan back when they were gattaca.
• Believes the metagame in MEV is to (1) start a builder because they are natural monopolies (2) succeed as said builder by making exclusive deals with searchers and other sources of flow. Emphasized the importance of networking, making deals, and exclusive orderflow.
• Bearish on SUAVE because doesn’t seem like entrenched actors will switch. But over the course of our conversation they seemed more pilled on it — especially when I described how SUAVE is a force for democratizing access to orderflow, so that actors can compete on building the best tech and products rather than on back door deals. Meritocracy vibes were received well.
• They don’t like private mempools because these can be used by blackhats. Their philosphy is that if everything is public, we will be safer, because there are more good than bad actors. And exploit detection tools don’t work well in private mempools. The last point was interesting because it reminds me of telegram bots trying to detect and protect users from rugs.

Had a convo with Eden today, some notes:
• Committed to shipping extra data auction, saying they will have a functional front end for goerli as soon as next week
    ◦ From the questions they asked they definitely have thought through shipping it
• They expressed very plainly their position that its rare you get to codevelop along a new platform so they want to take advantage of it as much as possible by building on top of SUAVE and publishing helpers/content etc
• Also expressed they hope we can give them things to work on that will drive value to Eden. 
    ◦ We have known this was their ask but sharing as they brought it up again.
• Next they want to iterate and make it a 2nd price auction and want to explore intents on SUAVE

I talked to UMA today. In short, they are very interested in having their Oracle Extractable Value use case be a leading use case on SUAVE. They had a series of technical questions on how stuff worked. On top of their mind is latency and who runs a kettle. They want to be able to run an auction on a 100ms heartbeat, basically, which they think is necessary for stuff like perpetual swap liquidations. As a part of that, they were imagining they'd have a kettle that was specific to their use case and weren't sure if they were going to be running it or not.

We also touched on things like key management, key rotation, and SGX which mattered to them a good deal! They had interesting questions about the specifics, e.g. if there would be one signing key for all SUAVE apps or if there would/could be signing keys per app. Shoutout to <@U055KQHH3FZ>, <@U03GALFRWRG> and crew for fighting the good fight for security and privacy - they are a leading and validating customer for your work.

One interesting thing is that they want to scale this to many, many chains but running their auction actually doesn't require any chain state. Theoretically all they need is the ability to export a signature with an arbitrary chainId. So we could have multichain apps earlier than we thought! I wonder how novel that design pattern is.

Finally, we talked about cross-chain swaps. They are building this uber cost optimized layer for settling bridging and cross-chain swaps. Again, they want somewhere to run an auction on top of this, and they also want support behind a generally more modular vision for the swap stack (in contrast to Uniswap X). I'm excited about that too and leaning in there as well, I think that auction is not going to all that different from the oracle auction too.

Only real followups here are to keep answering their technical questions and to talk more with them abut the x-chain swap stuff.

|   UMA and Hart Lambur esprcially is our biggest SUAVE fan, super bullish on us. They are super capable from financial engineering perspective and have a very deep understanding of defi design space. Hart was an OG tradfi trader in Goldman Sachs back in the days and has great insights into financial markets. 
Uma came to our researchathon. After devconnect, Hart gave me a lecture on how ccip will not work due to inefficiency in design. His goal is to outcompete chainlink without pissing off chainlink too early... This is the perfect team we can grow with.

We just had a meeting with Wonderland, here's my key takeaways. I (I asked <@U064F77UBHN> to take detailed notes as I was on the road, please share when ready and <@U05NYEHJUUW> can you establish an entry in Stakeholder CRM for Wonderland, and drop in my readout and <@U064F77UBHN> 's)
1. They are clearly a capable core research and development team, main expertise is application development, security research, on and across multiple domains.
2. They are selective in contribution , prefer core r&d contribution to a project, and earns equity or tokens for project they deliver
3. What's most interesting about their work relevant to us:
    a. Skeletor added MEV protection for Yearn cc. <@U03PZSSETQA>  (I also realized i invited him to speak on <http://MEV.wtf|MEV.wtf> in 2021) 
    b. They were working with OPLabs who pointed them to OP Foundation grant to work on Superchain cross chain messaging. <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03G4UY5NN9> 
    c. Their close collab with Connext as part of their core devs, my understanding is some sort of refactoring their existing core infra. Connext is a respected OG technical team in bridging. <@U03HT20PJES> <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
    d. Their work with GnosisSafe on multiple domains. 
4. Potential areas of collaboration:
    a. IMO they can be an interesting team to keep in mind for SUAVE core r&d, and tackle some existing thorning open research question, they are not just a dev shop based on their current key projects 
    b. We can research the MEV activities and application ecosystem on and across multiple domains. Would love to discuss with <@U03G4UY5NN9> as they are in talks with Nethermind on other fronts. 
I will do some background checks on their track record for delivery with OPLabs, Aztec, Connext to understand more.

> Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 05/12/2023 23:36:49 Z:
I talked to a top searcher-builder today, who asked to not be directly named. It was interesting and enlightening. I don't know how to add this to the CRM since it's a private chat and they requested to not be named.

tl;dr:
• The relay market at the top has intense competition. Ultrasound launched a new feature with the goal of becoming _the_ dominant relay. This in part rests on us not investing in our relay.
• Our builder's performance right now may be strongly related to our relay's lagging performance. In other words, we might lose a lot of our remaining share if we invest in improving the relay's performance.
• Builder-searchers are worried about other builder-searchers launching relays. They don't appear to want to be first movers.
• MEV-Boost being a 2nd price auction for builder-searchers is the top reason why they run a builder. They would not run a builder if it was not.
• Their builders was a fork of our geth builder with improvements since the start of the year, and hasn't been touched since then. Titan has spurned them to invest more in their builder again, as others are too. It seems the builder market will have a bunch of next-gen infrastructure coming onboard in the next quarter or two.
At more length:
On relay market structure:
• They briefly gave an overview of relay latency
    ◦ Ultrasound and BloxRoute are competing on relay latency, but are similar in latency. Both are p50 latency of 10ms and p90 20m.
        ▪︎ As an aside, they think that Titan's big jump last month (or the previous) was just Titan buying BloxRoute's "no simulation" feature
    ◦ Agnostic is sort of alive and optimistic, but not competing on latency. p50 latency 50ms, p90 100ms
    ◦ Our relay is alive and not really maintained. p50 latency 100ms, p90 500ms (!)
• They don't submit to our relay because the laggy block validation means their trades get adversely selected against more often since they can't update them.
    ◦ Our builder looks to be winning all its blocks on our relay because we
        ▪︎ don't care about adverse selection
        ▪︎ have protect flow
        ▪︎ have some amount of unique validators
    ◦ The follow on conclusion is that our builder's performance is, ironically, perhaps inversely related to our relay's performance!
• They have defensively prepared a relay in case they need to launch one if their competitors do. It's a bit like the spiderman meme. Their competitor has done the same. So both parties are worried the other will launch a relay, but both parties don't want to move first.
    ◦ One of the two commented to me that they didn't really want this to happen. It would, in part, break the mev-boost abstraction. Moreover, they thought it wouldn't be good for their profits either.
• They thought the Ultrasound Relay builder payment feature had a chance of being successful but didn't think it would be fast.
    ◦ Sidenote: I quickly checked with their top competitor, who raised that they don't think this feature will be successful.
• They think that the Ultrasound relay is trying to dominant the relay market with the stated goal of monetizing and then using public goods funding to fund backups in case they go off line. There is a logic to this with the builder payment feature, which incentives builders to only submit to the ultrasound relay.
    ◦ However, the success of this feature is the dependent on Ultrasound being soundly better than the next best in the market. We could put it out of business if we invested in our relay. It'd probably take 1 person a full quarter to get the relay to a decent place.
        ▪︎ Note this would box Ultrasound out from becoming dominant in the relay market, but it comes at the cost of our builder (for now), probably.
• They think the currently market is unstable and likely to shake up _somehow_.
On searcher-builder integration:
• They reiterated what we again know, which is that mev-boost being a 2nd price auction for them is the only reason why they run a builder
• They prefer to not run a builder at all.
• At 2nd price auction for SUAVE would be interesting for them
On builder competition
• They originally forked our OG open source geth builder as the basis of their builder with "some tweaks and features" (!)
• After Titan rose they and the other big searcher builders are now investing in upgrading their stack, they pointed to some people (incl us) rewriting it in rust
• In general, they think that builder competition is pretty intense
• They think the number of teams which could reasonably compete in the builder market right now is less than 10.

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 06/12/2023 05:26:12 Z:
|   Am I reading this right
1. Our relay being bad actually means our builder wins more of (our relay’s) blocks. Because other builders don’t submit to our bad relay.
2. But to shake up the relay market we would have to invest in making our relay better.
|   The note on them using a somewhat untouched geth builder makes sense under our thesis that the bidding strategy is hugely important
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 06/12/2023 05:28:58 Z:
|   Trying to understand the inverse correlation between our relay and builder performance as well
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 06/12/2023 11:03:09 Z:
|   <@U05DY4WTLUB> <@U03PZSSETQA> yes, that is a correct reading. The reason is that they do not want to submit their cex - dex trades to a relay that isn’t going to let them update their trades. Since our relay is more inefficient, they can’t cancel a grade and replace it where they can do that on performant relays. However, we actually do not care about that given we are a neutral relay. So we can submit stuff to our relay with impunit
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> it is hard to say how much they changed the geth builder. But yes. They are world class PGA bots and it is likely that matters /a lot/
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 06/12/2023 18:52:23 Z:
|   <@U02CJ9QVAL9> If we play this out, what would the impact be of us improving our relay? Seems like it could both
• Attract other builders to submit to our relay, which increases competition and reduces our own win rate _within our own relay_
• At the same time the relay could win more blocks overall so even if we have a smaller slice of the pie the pie may be bigger
Do we have a sense for which phenomenon is more impactful? Bigger slice of mev-boost market vs bigger slice of our own relay’s slice.

I get the sense we think owning more of mev-boost market is the way to go, if we have eg a small latency advantage at our relay that we don’t have at ultrasound. But want to explicitly play out the steps here and get input
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 06/12/2023 19:06:03 Z:
|   <@U03PZSSETQA>
• Improve: we up our relay inclusion rate and perhaps prevent ultrasound from dominating the market, but at the expense of our own builder. 
• Don't improve: our relay inclusion rate slowly dwindles to probably 0 and there's a chance that Ultrasound dominates the relay market. Then, there is a chance that this further accelerates builder-searchers to launch their own relays. Unclear how the market shakes out.
I don't know what's best. It's not clear to me that Ultrasound will dominate the market, especially with Titan coming to market and see their builder payment thing mostly fall flat. And I do like that neutral builders like us have some edge at our relay. It's quite tricky.

If you made me choose _right now_ what to do I'd continue on in the status quo without investing in our relay but with close monitoring to see if the situation is changing. The danger mode is if builders stop submitting to relays other than Ultrasound.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 07/12/2023 00:37:07 Z:

• Is there such thing as a middle ground where our relay is slightly more competitive vs ultrasound but not so much that we lose our edge at it
• Say builder-searchers launch relays. Is there a world in which this is not bad for us

:rocket: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Fastlane-x-SUAVE-e8167c691be44880828b4398ae2edc1f|Fastlane x SUAVE chat notes:>
1. :bricks: Interested in positioning atlas as an auction for builder's to win right to execute atlas transaction, this aligns well with proposal for SUAVE gtm as partial block forwarder to builders.
2.  :jigsaw: SUAVE's Role: Explored using SUAVE for handling tasks usually managed by rent-seeking middlemen in the AA supply chain (paymasters, bundlers, smart wallet companies, even wallet linkers that handle session keys and MPC). SUAVE allows concentrating all these roles into one kettle which is latency efficient.
3. :globe_with_meridians: Future Focus: Atlas audit will be completed in 1 - 2 weeks and deployed soon after. Wants to work together on creating a prototype Atlas SUAVE proof-of-concept once live, biggest feature request right now is a fast way to deliver messages back to front end, something we have also heard from CowSwap. They're willing to build an initial version to handle this:tada:
4. :teapot: Kettle operation: Fastlane wants to run their own kettles CC: <@U03HT20PJES> because they can hook up their geo-DNS to optimally route to nearest kettle, sending info back to user adds complexity but doable.
:pushpin: Action Items:
• Fastlane to send new diagram for PoC architecture in their mind
• Dmarz to clarify guidelines for customizing and operating kettles globally.

|   awesome!
|   just to confirm, they want to run their own kettles because they want to be minimise the latency between frontent and (kettle) backend?

|   Potential synergies that come to mind:
• decentralise they're centralised RFQ auctioneer infra
• use sgx to obscure taker flow from MMs to avoid frontrunning
• a little rusty on how the system works, but probably also choosing user execution option at block time

Had a short and interesting call with fireblocks today. They are looking for a solution to give their users (who are mostly large exchanges) privacy. But there is one key technical challenge that they need resolved in order to send us transactions.

*Problem:* Their users often send a ton of transactions in a short period of time (a “train” of txs). They have observed that it takes up to 1 second for new mempool txs to be recognized by the whole network. This means that eth_getTransactionCount on is often outdated by the time the next transaction in the “train” is submitted, and results in incorrect nonces.

*Their current solution:* They run their own node and query it for the right nonce. This avoids the gossip delay, and makes their updates very fast.

*The problem with switching to a private mempool:* Private transactions aren’t included in eth_getTransactionCount. We’ve previously brainstormed a solution for this where we would override the eth_getTransactionCount response to include private transactions. Ie (1) fetch public tx count from some random infura node, then (2) add the private transaction count to this result. But the problem with this approach for Fireblocks is that if any transactions in a train have been sent to the public mempool, (1) will be too slow. So they actually would prefer that we _just_ return (2) — the number of private transactions — very quickly, and not append it to some possibly outdated response for (1).

Tl;dr build an API that just shows the private tx count, and doesn’t add it to the public tx count. They understand that such an API would need to be authenticated and are going to connect me to their security team.

Other than this, they were curious to understand how refunds work. They seem eager to move ahead and wanted to get an estimate from us on feasibility + timeline for the new API.

I had some time to talk to Kubi of Titan. Some highlights:
• They are launching a relay defensively because they worry about their edge if the builder-searchers launch relays
    ◦ Conversely, he thinks that this might prevent the builders from launching relays
    ◦ He seemed to think that having a 10ms edge was enough for a single builder to dominate in the limit too
• They are sure that they can outcompete Ultrasound, expressing that they thought they could get the relay's performance down to _microseconds_ instead of milliseconds
• He let a bit of alpha slip about their building, not much, but some crumbs
    ◦ They have different building algorithms for different times in the block, because the end will often times have a lot of contention for e.g. cex/dex arb
    ◦ It sounded like they had a building algo specific just for cex/dex trading strategies, even
    ◦ They wrote a custom rust EVM long ago to do backrunning on alt-l1s easier and that's at the core of their simulation infra now
    ◦ He described some things similar to our storage access conflict resolution work that they were doing
    ◦ He stressed _a lot_ that the end of the block was the most important part
• Their strategy is, broadly, to get other market maker's flow and to try to use that to unseat SCP/Wintermute
• Their ultimate vision is to be an exchange for the blockchain
• They are interested in working with us on SUAVE. They'd be happy to put a private binary inside of an SGX for block building purposes, e.g. allow someone else to outsource building to that.

This past Tuesday, we had a call with <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Call-with-L2-Market-Maker-4002f7bbcd3f424ea7799b39e495eb12|Keyrock>, a <https://keyrock.eu/|market maker and liquidity provisioner out of the EU> (offices Belgium and the UK).

*Summary:*
• Keyrock has experience primarily in CEX but is exploring DeFi, particularly on Uniswap v3, with expertise in areas like arbitrages, AMMs, NFTs market making, and DEX orderbook. 
• They are planning to use reth to collect historical data on L2, expressed interest in collaborative research, and have the capacity to enter L2 now after completing two major projects. 
• They have a total of 190 people, engage in market making for various assets across multiple jurisdictions, and are considering expansion to other platforms like Cowswap and UniswapX (currently only solving for 1inch).
*Call to Action:*
• They are planning to go on Optimism, Mainnet, and Coinbase for market making and we can potentially collaborate with them on L2 application and orderflow market research (and potentially MEV inspect). cc: <@U03N9H4JP8C>

*Exploratory Call with old friend, flashbots fan Libevm:*  (<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Libevm-Flashbots-data-x-builder-collab-2f8b3224b20746bb81e0aba8e943e7c7?pvs=4|notes>)
1. *Collab with Penguin Builder (out of stealth mode today)*
_Tldr: imo super align and technically capable collaborator, currently in the learning stage. Open to share everything_ _with us._
• initially called uwu.builders in August then renamed to Penguinbuild.eth last month to be more mainstream
• Penguin builder had been landing *3.2%* last 1 day, *2.8%* last 7 days, *1.5%* last 30 days.
• Has been subsidizing *~1eth/*day. Capital comes from their own pocket, primarily Libevm’s prior MEV search profit . They can burn for at most 2 years, and hope to make money via CEX-DEX later, or else will have to raise capital. 
• Working on _geth-builder_ at the moment, despite Libevm actually wanting to write in _rust_ instead of _go_. They have been optimizing this Geth builder for the past 40 days gearing towards their launch.
• Libevm is open to potentially contributing, or eventually switching to rust builder if we open source. 
• Ask: they would like to receive MEV protect orderflow, created a PR on DOWG repo already
*2. <http://Libevm.com|Libevm.com> dashboard, potential market research data grant.*
Tl;Dr: data is their best marketing for the new block builder. Libevm is accidentally pulling off the mev-explore / mev-inspect marketing tactic - despite he stumbled upon building this viral dashboard purely because he was bored and was playing with the cryo tool paradigm open sourced recently to learn...

_Note from Tina: IMO if they can deliver the data analytics for market makers like Tokka Labs and a bunch others (they are all  lurking in his <http://libmev.com|libmev.com> tg channel despite_ _libevm has no idea who they are) - help them monitor their strategy profitability, and help them remove every mm's painful in house data infra work, they can win quite some trust from current and future orderflow game - it's a legit pain point, but not easy to service. Libevm may be able to pull it off as he loves devops and as a former searcher he understands their needs._

SNZ, a Chinese fund with its own staking service and an early investor (ICO early) of Ethereum, want to explore offering MEV-Boost relay service out of an interest to offer more services strategically important and to dive deeper into the ecosystem. They are well resourced and might be a good candidate to engage in the PBS Foundation for the APAC region.

They are currently trying to better understand the operation details and cost structure of running the relay. Who would be the best person for me to connect them to?

|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 16/01/2024 18:05:55 Z:
|   I suppose you want to do it by deduping tx addresses sent from them? This however would actually be number of users they have that use private transaction features.

For Bitget and ImToken we can get slightly closer to actual active users if we use their DEX router contract as a proxy, but not sure how to do it for OKX.

Had <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Intro-Call-f015e017a3424f7ab592e64d855413c6|an interesting call with Skeletor Spaceman> from Wonderland (also ex-yearn core dev). TLDR is they're a 35 person mostly solidity "protocol development and early-partnership shop" and have been helping Aztec, among many other protocols, and providing early feedback on their tooling and DevEx. They are interested in doing something similar for us. They would like to build out a UniV4 SUAPP + contribute to suave-std as a "free first-date" but then would prefer to enter in a multi-year contract, with a preference for token allocations (which I of course said we have no plans of).

Last night <@U03HT20PJES> and I hosted a pop up NYC TEE Party with some key and potential partners. Here's quick notes of my takeaways from my side of the table (<@U03HT20PJES> feel free to add yours if any!)

*What we discussed thats interesting or surprising to me:*
• Why does perp dex organically take off on Arbitrum instead of Optimism?
• Points systems changes the adoption game
• Offchain Labs is revisiting L1 gas pricing mechanism
• Skip Protocol pivoted from MEV to UX
*To Follow Up:*
:white_check_mark: Sorella Labs: ready to open source MEV tracing tools + dashboard for a grant
• MEV Taxonomy + Quantification Project Received Interest from Arbitrum and Chainlink Friends - potential funders? 
• Mike Neuder committed to create tech tree for PBS Foundation
• Ben Rodriguez commits to intro Coinbase data scientists to help with our market research

Do we still remember who from our side got the signer address labeled as “Bitget”? It is still the labeled origin that sent us the most orderflow but has been rapidly declining to less than 20% of previous volume. Need to contact the person that gave us the signer. Apparently it is a different team from the Bitget Wallet team that we are in contact with in Telegram.

|   i think he should seriously reconsider uniswap x thesis/design after seeing the existing data i presented in my blog post :P 

good take from doug colkitt, who is actually building a passive liq project: <https://x.com/0xdoug/status/1747853313565982874?s=46|https://x.com/0xdoug/status/1747853313565982874?s=46>
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 18/01/2024 06:12:20 Z:
|   We’ve been telling them to change for super long. I think they’ll eventually do it but will need to be pressured to do so. They worry about us calling them out specifically so your blog post is a good impetus. 
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/01/2024 07:13:05 Z:
|   If there is a one-line pitch, on what a uniswapx (or uniswap) redesign should look like, what would it be? :wink:
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/01/2024 07:20:01 Z:
|   as a first step they should:
• document their existing mechanism well and open it up to the public. 
• if they’re going to do a permissioned system (which i don’t know their process for whitelisting solvers) do better at not just focusing on onboarding scp/wm. i’ve received feedback from more than one market maker who was ignored by them. 
• actively publish and maintain open datasets
this is not a wild standard. cowswap does a great job at this. they have a ~1M permissionless stake, but they actively onboarded many solvers with kyc process and having them join a shared staking pool. all 13 solvers on cowswap right now are done via kyc and not the 1M stake.

cowswap also publishes great forum posts on mechanism design, when they change, and why. and their data is impeccable, traced from their api integrators to mev blocker to builders. batches are clearly laid out in different tables. etc.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/01/2024 07:28:45 Z:
|   then, they should discuss how to make it permissionless without making the barrier to entry super high. (maybe take a page out of mev share playbook)

it is unacceptable that they have 30% of order flow on ethereum, which can be used to experiment and push the frontier of defi, but instead use it to centralize power towards scp and wintermute, and one day citadel and virtu.

at 30% of order flow, the amount of searcher competition and price improvement they could get for their users from a permissionless system is highly nontrivial, especially given the composition of their order flow.

we show data in blog post that democratizing access to compete for retail order flow on ethereum does make a difference.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/01/2024 07:34:46 Z:
|   a more easy but impactful tweak for them: i think the 90% fill requirement especially benefits market makers. even their own crypto market makers comment this is broken and gameable.

they should check out cowswap’s mechanism for punishing cancellations: <https://forum.cow.fi/t/cip-20-auction-model-for-solver-rewards/1405>

they basically have to pay the difference between their solution and the second best solution, but it’s capped at 0.01 eth.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/01/2024 07:47:23 Z:
|   in general, the dominance and top heaviness of market makers on their platform is a direct consequence of their mechanism design and surrounding efforts/philosophy that market makers can provide the most competitive prices.

obviously personally think this is a false narrative given existing cowswap data on passive liq/CoWs setting a competitive lower bound/beating market maker quotes and that market makers only market make 50-70 tokens while 60% of Uniswap’s order flow is outside of these 50-70 tokens.

but i’ve heard they have this market maker thesis internally, so for anything we say we should probably start by convincing them away from this point first.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/01/2024 08:45:11 Z:
|   another thing — there is an “overrideBps” parameter where you can still win over the quoter during the exclusivity period. this is currently set at 1%, so a searcher not part of the permissioned set would have to quote a 1% better price to win against the permissioned set, which is _extremely_ high.

it’s hard to give suggestions here without knowing why exactly they added an exclusivity period in the first place.

> Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 18/01/2024 09:30:20 Z:
Filius @ Otex (top solver on cowswap) was speaking to me about the order flow post and wants to get into market making. He says that capital is the barrier to entry for them, and wants to know if there are any projects building permissionless liquidity provision, but for solvers to use for market making strategies.

They also want a connect to STEPN if anyone has that lol, looks like otex wants to integrate their DEX.

cc <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03G0PNEV0E> who may know of projects/STEPN peeps?

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 18/01/2024 09:49:36 Z:
|   could be a potential suapp

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/01/2024 10:36:22 Z:
|   I have been testing the idea of liquidity provision service as a suapp, imo it's quite suitable for a builder to provide (esp the builders already a market maker), some shower thoughts:
• Liquidity provision and risk management are two services that scale as a market matures, both can be critical services on suave
• The market has been small in the past cuz he cost of cap is not a constraint in the bear market - there's not enough market depth for capital to be very useful to scale an edge
• The market has been small also cuz solvers that are competent and in need of entering the game are not that many yet (for it to grow, imo what matters are flourishing of intent applications, diversity of apps gives rise to more small actors specialized )
• Geo decentralized liq provision -> can this be a necessary component to test out the negative latency overhead thesis?

|   It's tricky to do this across a block because of reorgs
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 18/01/2024 15:49:33 Z:
|   Maybe it's possible for some blocks, though! You could probably do it with appropriate risk management (e.g. only before Coinbase blocks because you know they won't forcibly reorg you) but it's not necessarily easy.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/01/2024 16:45:32 Z:
|   Yes, my jam session on NYC TEE party with Tarun was primarily on how to do the risk management as a service on SUAVE - multi block was a case that's useful but

so Grug is now doing an integrated oracle searcher project, should we poke more and see if it fits as a SUAPP? (I discussed with him briefly, seems he already talked with many Oracle projects and got some interest)

|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 18/01/2024 21:00:18 Z:
|   I think it could work as a SUAPP!

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 19/01/2024 07:35:51 Z:
|   this sounds similar to Oval (UMA's app that they built on top of mev-share)
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 20/01/2024 16:58:46 Z:
|   I think it’s also Oracle MEV but Grug is doing this by themselves running searchers and directly do deals with the Oracle project and promise to first give 100% of profit for a few weeks.

<@U05BMHJMRNK> and I just had a call with solver *Barter* (top solver on Cowswap, integrating Uniswap X).

They mentioned they are working on *expansion into L2s*, specifically Arbitrum. They plan to expand with Bebop as the order flow source, since apparently Cowswap is not planning to move to L2s due to technical issues. Hashflow and a new project, <https://lighter.xyz> will be the sources for PMM liquidity there.

I asked them about their Uniswap X integration, and they mentioned it is *hard for routing solvers to integrate Uniswap X* because Uniswap enforces rules on fee-charging that would force them to add a centralized exchange part to their setup. Basically it is harder for those without inventory to integrate without inventory/CEX since they would have to do an expensive on-chain swap to take a fee. Cowswap’s mechanism takes care of this process for them seamlessly, which is one of the many reasons we see more routing solvers on Cowswap than Uniswap X.

I also asked them about competition in Cowswap’s solver market, they mentioned Copium Capital doing well since they integrated Bebop and Wintermute provides more competitive quotes there than Hashflow due to cutting out Hashflow’s fees. Bebop is incubated by Wintermute so obviously has better market maker features — such as enforcing restrictions like no partial fills and bebop liquidity can only be sourced for the first leg of the trade.

They also mentioned solver Copium Capital exploiting a bug because *Cowswap actually allows trade internalization on their own liquidity pools that basically quote around an oracle — the best solver provided price*. The exploit is to find super high gas cost routes to provide a slightly better price, but leverage the internalization feature to mitigate the gas cost by having Cowswap pools quote it instead. I thought this was cool, similar to DFlow quoting around the best fee tier available on CEXs. _*They think Cowswap is expanding to building an AMM (maybe this is their hooks thing?)*_.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 19/01/2024 19:31:55 Z:
|   Can you expand on the fee problem in uniswap X? On first read it sounds like
• Uni X requires the filler to take a fee (why?)
• This is cheaper to charge on a CEX
But not sure I totally follow
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 19/01/2024 19:33:36 Z:
|   As a filler, you want to charge a fee to monetize. The fee setup is in a way where they have to do some type of swap/inventory management, and its cheaper to swap on a CEX than a DEX. I asked some clarification questions on the exact fee rule that Uniswap imposes in our shared tg group, waiting to hear back.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 19/01/2024 19:35:14 Z:
|   Ah so more about how mechanism of fee taking is designed. The cow swap one is more friendly to solvers that don’t have CEX inventory than the uni one
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 19/01/2024 19:37:33 Z:
|   yup, on cowswap, they submit solutions and the second price auction and fee calculation and everything is handled for them i believe from looking at the data their system produces

<@U03GRQX5HGR> where should I redirect technical support request from new public good relay operator? We do have a MEV-Boost relay APAC group chat on Telegram. Should I redirect them to post it there?

|   Always to the forum, imo. The more of these convos in the public the better. I don't think we want to hand-hold relays privately to get them started.

They can ask for reviews like this, which I think is fine and I'm happy to take a look.

• interop needs builders to enforce rules (opportunity)
• thinking governance-heavy system incl governance-selected builders
• they're heads down trying to ship "things that work" so don't want extra work

|   i think it is really easy to launch things on Optimism that then have access to real bridged tokens, i know that gas for DCAP is affordable there and forge support is good so I can use OP as a "rogue mainnet(?)" for foul sgx experiments. I don't know if this is relevant to the collab

|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 05/02/2024 15:47:39 Z:
|   generally: I think they're open but bandwidth constrained so we need to come to them with some proposals that require little lift from them. It would be even better if we shortened their dev path by outsourcing some stuff to suave (but no ideas on what this would be yet)

on <@U055KQHH3FZ>'s point: leveraging OP chains instead of SUAVE chain makes using SUAVE a lot more palatable to OP i think. Its also basically the anoma architecture minus their VM I think
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 05/02/2024 16:03:08 Z:
|   A bit in the weeds: If we did MEVM node in SGX, rollup chain nodes outside SGX, and a "hard coded" builder algo precompile (no fancy builder APIs) this would not be extremely hard. In fact I suspect the larger challenge would be DevOps in running the rollup nodes since faster block times (from experience Polygon & BSC were deceptively hard to keep in sync)

Hello,

This is Can Kisagun. I co-founded Enigma /Secret Network which was the first privacy preserving smart contracting platform and recently I worked on a <https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/blob/main/FRPs/active/FRP-40.md|research grant> to explore the DeFi applications that can be built on Suave.

I am exploring building a DEX on Suave that executes trading orders on Suave and keeps user funds / settlement on Ethereum. I believe this has a lot of benefits over L2 DEXs that can improve DEX execution quality. I would really appreciate the opportunity to get your feedback as a PMM on some of the design choices I am considering and understand what set of choices would create the most value for you.

Cheers

• they're heads down trying to ship "things that work" so don't want extra work

:mega: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Intro-to-SUAVE-819e7391044c4fd89cea52d1b3c7a1e6|Balancer <> SUAVE readout>:
• *funnel perspective:* read the clave LVR post from our devconnect hackathon, thought it was super cool, want to make sure balancer v3 is SUAVE compatible as they're preparing for war against the appchain DEX thesis (reading between the lines Uniswap chain)
• *product perspective:* SUAVE gives them differentiation (LVR mitigation) in a trust-minimized way. (Interestingly enough said they were fine to start experimenting on mainnet w/o SGX)
    ◦ they have two ideas: 1) first pool access auction 2) 0 fee pass auction for solvers
• *collaboration perspective:* they want to move fast, resource constrained as smart contract engineers are pushing for v3 launch in early Q2, are willing to play with incentivized pools to bring people
    ◦ Instead of us designing and PoC'ing I suggested a route that leverages our community to host a researchathon to nerd snipe devs & mechanism designers similar to what we did with UF, they're very interested. EthLondon even potentially feasible w/ Balancer v2
• *Next Steps:* they will send over pointers to how we could build this with balancer v2 today along with early v3 spec, I will assess feasibility and discuss internally, then we come back to them in ~ 2 weeks

Caught up with Pete (BD) from EigenPhi (<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/EigenPhil-Tina-2024-catch-up-4d1de2eb8d7e484ab964315774af1f67?pvs=4|full notes here>), here is a readout:
• EigenPhi in 2024 is focused on *exploring revenue generation* due to pressure to raise $$.
• Their positioning is to be a _curated data provider_, not exclusively in MEV. 
• There are exploring 3 areas at the moment
    a. Order flow analysis - _analyze OFA in one go -> Not scalable (yet)_
        ▪︎ providing bespoke analysis for a few paying customers to help them value/trade orderflow, pretty manual, hard to scale
        ▪︎ trading firms do not know how to price (orderflow/data) and asked them for something very rough → market is early
        ▪︎ feels that this may eventually take off when usage pick up, but too early now
    b. Regulatory / compliance: _analysis on life cycle of tokens -> Not started yet_
        ▪︎ EU’s MiCa introduces _transparency and disclosure requirements_ for crypto issuers and providers, is a potential opportunity for them, but still early.
        ▪︎ They are planning on hosting a Webinar on this topic after Chinese New Year.
        ▪︎ Interested in collaborating with our Policy workstream.
    c. AI x MEV product: super early exploration on dynamic slippage with Sogol Malek (founder of <http://xtremely.ai|xtremely.ai>) -> only started talking
        ▪︎ <http://xtremely.ai|xtremely.ai>: AI-powered dynamic slippage-MEV solution as-a-service, minimize trade failures, Optimize MEV, maximize profit (already in touch with SUAVE <@U05BMHJMRNK>) 
• Areas of collab
    ◦ State of MEV 2024 - Pete needs to ask their founders first
        ▪︎ Potentially contribute/review MEV taxonomy update
        ▪︎ Open to explore what on the orderflow front can contribute around orderflow.art <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U05578MHMUZ> 
    ◦ May depends on the size of the grant and area of interest
• PBS Foundation grants
        ▪︎ Simon from PBS foundation had asked Pete for potential data grant
    ◦ They have not found angle to collab given Eigenphi’s late focus on monetization
• Events
    ◦ EthDenver
            • Pete + a data scientists will be at EthDenver
            • Eigenphi will give a talk on MEV research based on tx availability (?)
        ▪︎ no Eigenphi events in Denver
    ◦ Pete is interested in opportunity of giving a talk on <http://MEV.market|MEV.market> in March, though not going to London at the moment
• Next Steps
    ◦ Intro Pete with <@U04QCPQ0CG5> to explore policy/data collab
    ◦ Intro Pete with Tesa Ho (Market Research Lead candidate) to meet at EthDenver, to follow up on State of MEV 2024 initiative collab <@U03GRQX5HGR> 
    ◦ Loop EigenPhi in after <http://MEV.Market|MEV.Market> have a rough agenda <@U03TD87PTMK>

• solana is continuous time so blocks are a stream and validators execute txns as they come in
• JITO is a discrete time auction so validators have to redirect the tx stream into their sidecar "relayer" client which will hold for 200ms and "run the auction"
    ◦ The relayer under the hood makes calls out to the closed source JITO block engine which constructs the best block and streams this back in
• solana has inclusion issues because their scheduler is "poorly implemented".
    ◦ validators have 4 threads which each have their own local view of priority queues which incentivizes spam and randomness
    ◦ next version v 1.18 will have a single priority queue that threads pop from and will redirect accounts touching similarly locked state to the same thread
• Their sim systems are getting uber saturated so curious if we had any ideas for how to help. Said reputation system is best path and they said thats what they're already working on

just had a call with Remi from "<https://www.inco.network/|Inco>". I pretty much talked him completely out of using FHE but encouraged him to reach out to <@U05BMHJMRNK>, they are interested in making a platform for "gaming" with low privacy expectations. They care a lot about developer experience and like to talk with gaming app developers so maybe they are useful partner to suave
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 18/02/2024 14:53:57 Z:
|   Inco is a protocol that originally wanted to implement Zama's FHE framework.
Am I reading correctly that you really managened to talk them out of FHE? Does that mean they would be interested to build it on top of SUAVE?
|   
|   > Andrew Miller [U055KQHH3FZ] @ 18/02/2024 14:58:18 Z:
|   Well on their own they decided FHE is too expensive so they want to use TEE for faster performance and development... even as an option for users who "don't need the full privacy of FHE". The convincing was about how FHE is not adding privacy unless it's combined with TEE too (collusion risk from decryption, and having to rely on fraud proofs for the operations on encrypted data)
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 18/02/2024 14:58:42 Z:
|   right. That part of the pitch never made sense to me
|   FHE without MPC or TEE = ???
|   
|   > Andrew Miller [U055KQHH3FZ] @ 18/02/2024 14:59:06 Z:
|   I think they could be talked into building on SUAVE since they are not backend protocol ppl I think they're unlikely to want to use Gramine directly. Phala might be a better fit for them though if they don't need MEV features

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 16/02/2024 22:33:20 Z:
<@U05BMHJMRNK> and I just had a chat with Austin Adams and Mark Toda about building UniX on SUAVE. Tl;dr is that
• they would love to launch something more "decentralised" soon. 
• They have thought about a bunch of designs including eigenDA based stuff but nothing really makes sense
• They're pretty keen on something very basic on SUAVE as this gives them:
    ◦ the memetics of a path to decentralisation
    ◦ the devEx of solidity and foundry which is what their team is used to
• They're comfortable starting off and running this all on one node without SGX 
• Pitching it internally on Thurs.
• Their biggest questions were around timelines: when can they ship? 
Full <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/UniX-jam-c0cae89b8769431d82dccb436d26669e?pvs=4|notes>

This conversation made me think that what we most need to gain market share and people building on SUAVE isn't anything live now, but clarity on the future. This means providing people with a clear roadmap and giving them an inclination for the latency overhead SGX will cause (IMO this should be one of our key focuses)
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 19/02/2024 20:38:23 Z:
|   *Confidential*:

Whispers that Uniswap Labs legal and risk operations are in limbo and have been for a while now. They have no concrete strategy for how UniX operates within or outside of DeFi definitions and there is push and pull internally about making something more decentralized vs. building things like X that are more focused on better prices and LVR mitigation, etc.

Their head of policy recently left to <https://blog.uniswap.org/welcome-salman-banaei|return> to the SEC; their GC, who is a notable name in tech/finance circles is likely on his way out / not engaged; most stuff is falling to MCL.
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 19/02/2024 21:33:44 Z:
|   So how do we position SUAVE as helping the most in this light <@U04QCPQ0CG5>? (which I know is not an easy answer... but how do we even get the ball rolling?)
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 22/02/2024 16:47:31 Z:
|   Brendan from Paragim Policy and I will write a post on the design space for decentralization that should be a roadmap to this exact question outling the risks that defi protocol need to address with their design for regulatory reasons and a framework for how they can approach this technically that maps back to suapps and suave and sgx. We are starting on it next week when he is back from his honeymoon and hope to work on it quickly.

|   <@U055KQHH3FZ> this post could also be used to motivate the value of research into a new architecture with a decentralised root of trust

I spoke with libevm and minimoon today about their experience running a block builder (penguinbuild), and got their input on product ideas and what they’d like to see in the relay market. Major takeaways:
• They’re a small early team. They want to become profitable but are largely motivated by curiosity and fun. While they’re exploring CEX DEX, they haven’t committed or gone deep on it yet.
• Orderflow is king. “The biggest barrier to standing up a new builder is acquiring orderflow”. Bananagun is the most valuable and selective flow today. They’ve had trouble getting access to it — “we are out of ideas”. Searcher flow (except CEX DEX) is much easier to get.
• The main challenges for <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Bring-back-partial-block-building-fe3db95ca9de4963bdda63e5493112f8?pvs=4|partial block building> are (1) latency and (2) whether it can effectively handle bidding on behalf of other builders. They’d want some guarantees (eg. “don’t over-subsidize) but they’re willing to try it out because they already have so much trust in the relay anyways. They see this all happening as features on the relay.
• Note: A main reason they subsidize is because they need to maintain 1% market share over 30d to get MEVBlocker flow. Maybe there’s a feature here around “subsidize on my behalf to ensure I remain eligible for MEVBlocker flow”.
• A major pain point with the MEV-Boost market today is that relays are opaque and it’s not always clear if you’re getting the features you pay for. “Some relays with optimistic mode who are not ultrasound” appear to be giving priority to certain builders. They didn’t want to DOX but have issues with certain relays. The market has become political.
• They love Ultrasound’s websocket feed of bid data. They want us to upgrade our bid feed to use websockets and generous (*read-only*) rate limits. They don’t care about increasing the rate limit for writes (what SCP asked for); they think they can optimize when they post well enough. Having a great public source of bid data with will reduce the advantage for bigger teams (esp around rate limits, ”rsync has 16 servers they read from and we only have 1”).

I (finally) managed to get in touch with jetbuilder :tada:
• They were very positive about flashbots and said they’re grateful for how much we help new builders get started.
• They validated each of the top pieces of user input that we’ve heard recently. Access to orderflow is the main pain point for new builders; and they want us to support optimistic mode and top bid websockets on our relay.
• Their goal is measured in market share (1%, then 5%). They find it hard to reach 5% without sufficient orderflow.

Had a good meeting with Partha (4337 coordinator):
• Wants to offer the etherspot bundler as a domain specific services on SUAVE that can eventually go multi-chain
• Had a bunch of questions on docs and specs which shows he has started digging in
    ◦ We have "how to write a precompile" but now we need a "how to write a domain specific service"
• Yoav and other 4337 core devs are interested in SUAVE adopting <https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rip-7560-native-account-abstraction/16664/1|RIP 7560> as a test bed since no other rollups are offering it soon + because multichain and chain abstraction allows them to test much more nuanced cross-chain intent flow 
• Partha starting a SUAVE <> 4337 Core Devs TG chat to continue convo, lmk if you want in

I had a call with boba builder (siege rhino) today. They had a bunch of feature ideas for the relay and collaborative block building! We also chatted about their experience as a builder and some questions around building on SUAVE.

Highlights:
• Siege Rhino is an arbitrage trader. They started a builder in order to capture second price and access more MEV. Their edge comes from (1) technical optimizations like algo and performance and (2) exclusive flow from bottom-block arbs (their specialty).
• Access to orderflow is a primary challenge. It’s hard to be new. They recently lost flow from some top searchers (jared) and don’t know why.
• Their goal is to capture the second price. They had several feature requests for our relay to help reduce latency in strategic bidding.
    ◦ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Boba-builder-chat-46e2dc8f8d54470e9ef3fddf2b1bad0e?pvs=4#0d815b0b8e2443869dccb2aeb24ef7ae|Colocation> — a “fast lane” service for searcher builders
    ◦ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Boba-builder-chat-46e2dc8f8d54470e9ef3fddf2b1bad0e?pvs=4#c4a5221bbc574701b188d980d2e4bdcb|Faster bid updates> — don’t block on older bids from the same builder
    ◦ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Boba-builder-chat-46e2dc8f8d54470e9ef3fddf2b1bad0e?pvs=4#5cc77010f5f946f29c5a33e444b9a676|Top bid websockets> — a live feed would be a lot better than querying our API
    ◦ <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Boba-builder-chat-46e2dc8f8d54470e9ef3fddf2b1bad0e?pvs=4#c76b1610682543168ad73c614974c53b|Send many bids to relay in advance> — allow builders to pre-submit many bids for the relay to choose from. This is different from ultrasound’s bid adjustments feature.
• They are interested in collaborative building and have an idea for a <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Boba-builder-chat-46e2dc8f8d54470e9ef3fddf2b1bad0e?pvs=4#ca6697c917f9424aafc42239cfb9ecbb|builder cooperation platform>.
    ◦ “It’s a shame” that sometimes two builders have unique alpha / ordering which could be combined — but because neither wants to leak alpha, they compete instead of cooperate, and both of them lose.
    ◦ Say one builder has a great ordering algorithm and another has great orderflow. Ideally you could send the unsigned txs to the great algo, receive an optimally ordered result, and then provide signatures. A major problem is that revealing the best ordering is an alpha leak.
    ◦ SCP and Nathan were interested in the idea, but worried it would be too complex.
• We talked about partial block building — they think it’s like regular bundle merging but we would need new merging rules. Specifically we need authorization to *break* bundles but keep the relative ordering because there will be overlap.
• They asked about SUAVE and why block building on SUAVE would be superior. They are concerned it won’t give them better access to orderflow if users have to opt into each builder SUAPP; and that the latency will not be competitive. They haven’t taken it seriously yet because it isn’t mature.

i'm looking to support propellerheads, who is one of our key suapp partners, on guidance for audits -- (1) how the process works and (2) the timeline / prices / possible auditors. i'm thinking of asking samczsun -- do we have a group chat with paradigm? cc <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03FP0H62HH>

|   <@U03G59ZN90D> I would like to understand a bit better what you are trying to do.
1. for a how to tutorial and who's who in the space, practically speaking, keep in mind <@U03H6U5F200> <@U03FQH1553P> were top auditors in the space. <@U055KQHH3FZ> <@U03GKHM4G9Z> audited the biggest protocols in the space. 
2. If you just wanna quickly help get Propellerhead connected to audit firms as a favor, we can easily do that - we are connected to pretty much everyone in the space. If propellerhead is looking for a close intro to skip the line in waiting for an audit owe may be helpful. 
3. knowing propellerhead and other mev time applications will likely very specific types of auditors, it may be worthwhile to discuss internally what auditors are suited to provide it. it's not necessarily easy.
If your ask is about learning /exploring flashbots offering audit services as part of GTM support, we should explore the ecosystem support we can provide systematically, and in context of what other support that can lock in suapp to deploy on SUAVE.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 27/02/2024 09:12:17 Z:
|   there might also be a general strategic consideration here. if you remember, in Mexico we whiteboarded what SUAVE will need to succeed. we had "availability of audits" pretty high up on the list for successful SUAPPS.
maybe we can start putting out some feelers to audit firms to onboard them to early SUAVE, so they can be ready to audit SUAPPs early on
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 27/02/2024 11:05:33 Z:
|   <@U03FP0H62HH> I agree audits are a chokepoint in app deployment - I encourage us to think about audit not in a standalone sense, but from the lifecycle of app development perspective to think about what we can offer. 

furthermore, I would like to learn from our SUAVE team on suapp audits - what does it take. 

would love to hear from <@U03G3CSRBQR> <@U05BMHJMRNK> on this since devx is part of the Centauri team Q1 OKR, I assume theres quite some thoughts around suapp. and

|   Waiting after catchup with <@U05BMHJMRNK> about y'alls meeting yesterday. I don't think we are at a place to get suapp audits now, but it makes sense strategically to start working with audit firms for when that's a need from partners and early adopters (in like 6 to 12 months?) :thinking_face:

Audits generally can be a drag, expensive and not very helpful. For instance, the mev-boost audits found some low hanging fruits but missed some really critical bugs that were not that obvious, but which they absolutely should have caught too. I guess much of it is for marketing...

Back to the original message from <@U03G59ZN90D> -- I'm not sure what you are trying to do... You are asking about what's the process, but it's unclear to me what you mean -- process for what? And what would you like to do with samczsun.

|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 27/02/2024 13:59:51 Z:
|   ^not much to add! Maybe some context, I've been working on Propeller Heads since DevConnect and it seems like they are just turning the corner towards serious about this and starting development this week. This is the first coherent SUAPP pitch/partner so it has not made sense to talk about audits on non-existent partners :slightly_smiling_face:

That being said, <@U055KQHH3FZ> has been floating an andromeda security audit, so perhaps whoever does that we could try and get some bulk deal with if we bring a string of SUAPPs?

*Key Takeaways:*
• *Tbuilder Initiatives*
    ◦ Confirmed a 42 ETH subsidy for December to penetrate the market.
    ◦ *Subsidizing Strategy*: Prioritize subsidizing blocks during Asia hours due to their lower value compared to US hours.
    ◦ *Motivation for Building a Builder*:
        ▪︎ Aim for greater control over transaction flows to ensure settlement; mitigate exclusion risks from Beaver/Rsync, noting a 0.1% exclusion rate.
        ▪︎ Titan is more neutral
        ▪︎ Exact profit is clear to calculate, allowing greater control and confidence when bidding.
        ▪︎ Upcoming MEV/searching strategies necessitate certainty in settlement.
    ◦ *Colocation Sites*: Singapore, Tokyo, NYC, Frankfurt.
• *Searching Plan*:
    ◦ Launch atomic backruns on their builder before expanding to CeFi-DeFi strategies.
    ◦ Testing on Arbitrum/Optimism; awaiting features like decentralized sequencer and cross-chain capabilities.
    ◦ Inquiry about Flashbots’ support for transitioning to L2, specifically data on L2 MEV.
• *Tokka Labs’ Engagement with UniX*
    ◦ Despite lower volumes, ranks in the top 2 by transaction share percentage, alongside Flow Traders.
    ◦ Wintermute excels in filling larger orders due to their inventory advantages.
    ◦ Plans to expand inventory are in place.
    ◦ Wintermute is dialing back on DeFi/MEV efforts to reallocate resources, also acknowledging the downsides of centralization for PBS narratives.
• *Partnership with Native DEX*
    ◦ Native promotes a unified liquidity layer, offering a multisided marketplace to match strategy, inventory, and order flow.
    ◦ Tokka Labs identifies order flow and inventory as their primary needs.
• *Concerns Regarding Intent Platforms*
    ◦ Governance and unilateral changes pose concerns, with limited visibility and control over the process highlighted.
    ◦ The credibility of these platforms running on centralized infrastructure is not a major concern.
*Follow-ups*
• Share L2 market research insights with Tokka
• Share SUAVE Solver Sell Pitch when we have it formalized

|   <@U03TD87U6ER> <@U05578MHMUZ> fun fact for block building — tokka takes the timezone into account when subsidiziing blocks. Ie they don’t subsidize during US business hours because it’s more expensive. Might be relevant for when we start exploring this

|   > danning [U05578MHMUZ] @ 28/02/2024 19:05:43 Z:
|   They also said they use Relay Data API to adjust bids and don’t find the rate limit/latency as an issue
<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Paraswap-adfa146f76ff46d2badb9f5b4debcc58|Paraswap 1:1> notes - Oxytocin (Carlos), Agustin Grosso (<@U05578MHMUZ>, <@U06HLMRPYLV>)

*Key Takeaways:*
• Paraswap is the 2nd/3rd largest dex aggregator after 1inch, at similar scale as 0x;
    ◦ orderflow side: 80% coming from integrator partners (dapps, lending protocol (AAVE), wallets …) and 20% from their frontends.
    ◦ liquidity side: integrated with hashflow, also has 5~8 their own market makers; well coverage on AMMs
    ◦ Team is launching v6 Router this week (gas improvment etc - see detailed notes above), after which they will fully focus on building out the *Intent Model Portikus*
        ▪︎ see talk notes here about this intent model: <https://www.notion.so/Paraswap-Talk-Notes-Making-Intents-Right-with-Paraswap-b9af6f8eaab0422fb7fbef9c929a52d7?pvs=21|Paraswap Talk Notes - Making Intents Right with Paraswap>
• TLDR on their solver model
    ◦ Why starting the solver model? It’s not just a dex solver, they wanna serve more usecase with a generalized intent model
    ◦ It’s very similar to SUAVE; generalized for all use cases
    ◦ launching with single-solver (paraswap solver) for dex swap use case first; team will run a relay (the orderflow broacaster &amp; tx submitter &amp; the auctioner)
        ▪︎ In their model it’s not the solver submitting batch, neither the paraswap team but the “decentralized relayer”
        ▪︎ But in reality because they will launch with the team running a relayer as first example, it will end up the same as cowswap (the platform submitting)
    ◦ Barter &amp; a bunch solvers are interested to onboard their platforms; their Marker Makers are also interested
    ◦ The UI will be built separately (i.e. not in Paraswap frontend), likely from their existing integrators who are interested in niche use cases
    ◦ The relayer network (the decentralized layer) sounds very much like what SUAVE can provide; they are open to just build on SUAVE even it means it’s gonna be replacement of their relayer network design (since it’s early phase);
    ◦ They asked if it makes sense to launch on suave even they plan to launch with single solver? Danning answer: we have other interested solver who can potentially join and partner 3-way
    ◦ Fee &amp; revenue for solver? in research phase and very open ended (commission based, PFOF, revenue sharing) - Danning pitched that if they put the auction on SUAVE then they can design 2nd price auction for winning solver to get profits
        ▪︎ but they said this might be counter to their interests in the beginning phase when they will try to bring better price improvement to users
*Follow-ups:*
• Their questions about SUAVE <@U05BMHJMRNK>:
    ◦ Is it gonna be a L1 or a rollup?
    ◦ When will it be live? in 1 or 6 or x months? so they can figure out if it’s aligned with their plan and capacity
    ◦ Live on what network? (i replied ETH mainnet mostly likely)
    ◦ They want to know more technical details of “what implementations / modules they need to build” if partnering on the use case
*Action Items:*
• to share today’s notes with SUAVE team to know if paraswap can be a potential partner to build a solver platform model use case on SUAVE;
• after syncing with SUAVE team, if we wanna chat them further, set up a call with technical folks both side so to be able to discuss further <@U05BMHJMRNK>

*Key Takeaways:*
• They are eagerly looking for fundraising (4-5m with 40eval) - ghosted by Tom Dragonfly; received acq offer from Hashflow, MM, <http://Li.Fi|Li.Fi>, and 2 others; but they believe they can build much bigger thing
    ◦ The angle they pitch is to offer their routing (almost as competitor of dex aggregator) to different frontend to integrate their orderflow with their AMM routing algo - get connected behind each frontend as a router
• *Eager to partner with us to build suapp usecase (can help their VC pitch with branding) - e.g. deploying their routing algorithm on SUAVE to showcase the “Universal Solving Endpoint” example <@U05BMHJMRNK>*
• Their orderflow &amp; partners:
• Ethereum:
        ▪︎ Cowswap: main business
        ▪︎ Def not gonna work with 1inch anytime, but if we can provide endpoint for solving the flow they are happy to
• On UniX they cannot compete with MM, but they were 40% in June before WM onboarded
        ▪︎ They also need to manage the tokens they receive in commission to convert it to stables/ETH → all these add the complexity to integrate
        ▪︎ Orderflow from Bebop (enso is also there), Hashflow frontend (exclusive)
        ▪︎ Lido is gonna launch (in 3mo) a UI and Barter is providing AMM routing for stETH liquidity thru a platform (built by prev CTO of nethermind Greg)
    ◦ They signed an NDA with Consensys to work with SMG for the OFA and “other MEV activties”
• Arbitrum:
    ◦ Launching with Hashflow (getting their frontend traffic and routing AMM for them)
Follow-up
• <@U05BMHJMRNK> SUAPP use case follow-up for next week.  Nikita isnʻt sure he or his team will be able to attend EthLondon due to visa constraints.
Action-item
• <@U05578MHMUZ> share the Universal Solver Endpoint doc with SUAVE team (dmarz) and follow up if our team can build with Barter

Banana Gun 1:1 (<@U06HLMRPYLV> <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U05578MHMUZ> <@U05DY4WTLUB>)

*TLDR:*
• Technically competent team. Cool people. Care about trust model and security but pragmatic about when to pursue them.
• The top priority is inclusion speed and rate, followed by execution quality.
• Users don’t like backrunning. Titan’s end-of-block state diff auction is acceptable as there is no immediate backrunning tx following the swap.
• Trading volume is split between 30% sniping and 70% regular swaps.
• The routing mechanism currently supports AMM on the mainnet without multi-hop functionality, but there’s consideration for routing/solving outsourcing.
• Aiming to expand by offering a general trading frontend and becoming an aggregator. 
*Notes*
• *Team Background*
    ◦ Daniel is based in Hungary.
    ◦ The team, consisting of 6 members all located in Europe, comprises primarily of people with degen background, with a focus on sniping.
    ◦ Initially, they developed tools for their own use and for friends, due to the inadequacy of existing tools.
    ◦ Currently, the team earns less from operating their Telegram bot compared to their previous trading activities.
• *Go-To-Market Strategy*
    ◦ Growth has been purely organic, without any marketing efforts.
    ◦ Engaged in a $5k bribe to Etherscan for labeling the Bananagun router.
• *Product Overview*
    ◦ *Priority of Needs:* The top priority is inclusion speed and rate, followed by execution quality.
    ◦ *Current State:*
        ▪︎ The focus is primarily on EVM platforms, with less enthusiasm for Solana.
        ▪︎ Trading volume is split between 30% sniping and 70% organic swaps.
        ▪︎ The routing mechanism currently supports AMM on the mainnet without multi-hop functionality, but there’s consideration for routing/solving outsourcing.
    ◦ *Technical Competence:*
        ▪︎ Demonstrates high technical competence, especially in achieving high node uptime, exceeding the reliability of typical node service providers and their customer support.
        ▪︎ Conducted network optimizations akin to Bloxroute’s. Similar result to the vanilla paid version before any secret backdoor paid upgrade.
    ◦ *Future Plans:*
        ▪︎ Aiming to expand by offering a general trading frontend and becoming an aggregator, with API availability following Dex Tool integration.
        ▪︎ Competitive edge in safety features in the API for degen retail use cases, including built-in simulations for state difference calculations, optimal inclusion block predictions, rug pull protection…
    ◦ *Security and Trust:*
        ▪︎ Focused on improving the trust model and security for users, aiming to move away from the current model of “Trust me bro with your private key” by using account abstraction and session keys.
        ▪︎ Gas fees are not considered a major issue as the *permit* operation’s costs are borne by Bananagun, not the users.
    ◦ *Service Providers:*
        ▪︎ Utilizes Chainbound Fiber to get fast block data and employs Titan as the builder.
    ◦ *Expansion Beyond ETH L1:*
        ▪︎ Collaborated with the Blast team for a potential launch, hindered by a lack of ready node setup instructions/resources.
        ▪︎ Scheduled to launch on Base in the following week.
• *Exclusive Orderflow*
    ◦ Engaging in experiments with OFA, initially off-chain payments with Titan, moving to on-chain. Shifted from Beaver to Titan.
    ◦ Users don’t like backrunning. Titan’s end-of-block state diff auction is acceptable as there is no immediate backrunning tx following the swap.
    ◦ Manages relationships with builders by distributing to the top 4, setting requirements for inclusion performance to incentivize sharing among builders
    ◦ Doing on-chain builder attribution showing which builder the tx was originally sent to post-unbundling incidents.
• *Assessment of Competing Telegram Bots*
    ◦ UniBot lacks capability and focuses heavily on marketing.
    ◦ Maestro, being an early starter, has become too comfortable and slow in innovation and development.
    ◦ In TG bot competition, Banana Gun insists on priority inclusion over others, a strategy that took Maestro months to decipher.
*Follow up*
• Provide help on designing & running routing/solving for the new aggregator service, potentially on SUAVE.
• Share L2 state of MEV data to them when ready

|   Because there is still a very negative connotation of it among their users. Frontrunning, backrunning, sandwiches are all perceived as MEV attacks to them. It also does not fit their expectation of private tx if they see their tx backrunned every single time.

|   they are simple men and dont wanna deal with anything related with negative optics (generally "MEV" attacks) and sniping is more of a thing that doesnt harm users much.

(i guess u could also argue backrun may hurts LPs with impermanent loss even if not the trader)

what does this mean? strategy to be top of block? i thought maestro does do this though before bananagun was even live

Question from Steve Ellis (Chainlink architect)- “Hey, we're trying to get some data around auctions, they asked for the MEV-Blocks API but I'm not sure that's right. Who is the best person to connect someone from my team with?” Anyone with context want to take this? I can intro if helpful

|   What kind of auctions? If it's block auctions then the best way is to get each relay's bids using their API. Block API just gives you the first 100 txs from any flashbots built blocks, so I don't think that's what they're looking for

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 10/03/2024 17:11:14 Z:
Been digging into polygon agg layer ahead of meeting them this week. They're basically offering a solution which does proof aggregation (settlement cost savings) and atomic xchain interop (bigger selling point due to UX and liquidity gains).

I'm honestly still trying to wrap my head around the details of their scheme but it seems like there are a few points we should touch on with them:
• it seems some of their constructions have a similar problem to optimism where sequencers misbehaving can cause delays/bad preconfs
• they have some thoughts on how x-chain atomic sequencing could look (see 3rd screenshot) and this is something we are also trying to enable
• we could use zk proofs to improve the TEE trust model in the long run (a carrot to dangle for them)

I had a call with ward and malcom (stat arb searchers) last week. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Ward-Malcom-call-382faa56787f4a1f80a5b6518dfa88a3|Here’s the CRM summary> and a few highlights

On block building
• They’d prefer not to run a builder but see advantages in capturing the second price, having more reliable cancellations, and minimizing latency in the 0.1% of highly contested blocks.
• They’d love us to support second price bundles again. They’re open to giving a single builder “first look” exclusivity and have also been talking with titan.
On new features
• They think colocation is overkill from a latency perspective but are interested in being able to act on private state. They are big fans of titan’s bottom block backrun feature.
• They think state lock auctions make sense and would be straightforward for stat arb but hard to implement for atomic arb because the bids are combinatorial.
• They weren’t sold on the binance API but suggested an alternative where searchers stream us their best bundles.
Other
• They like RFQs because they keep more profit, but have noticed some issues with the implementation of uniX.
• They shared some tricks of the CEX leg of CEX-DEX arbs, which are harder for atomic searchers to get up to speed on.
• They do a small amount of L2 searching and prefer FCFS because they don’t have to pay as much to validators. They expect to do more in the future.

> Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 12/03/2024 14:56:40 Z:
I talked with Mattia and Ruben from IMC, a tradfi market maker that’s looking to get involved in defi. They are interested in CEX DEX arbs and wanted to talk because they heard that you have to run a block builder to compete at stat arb.
• I laid out the pros/cons of running your own builder and addressed some misconceptions (eg. there are successful independent stat arb teams)
• Two other questions / dots they shared that were interesting
    ◦ Does an integrated searcherbuilder have an advantage in valuing their arbs based on the predictive edge of their orderflow?
    ◦ What’s the fastest way to know what bundles were included? “Confirmation latency” seems important to their operations

I got dinner with Stephane last night. He is excited to build stuff for wallets on SUAVE, in particular he wanted to build better tooling around custody and keys for wallets. Two immediate use cases:
• SUAVE multi-sig: imagine SUAVE has a private key. The use case is to program when and how that private key is used, as an example, requiring both a signature from another key as well as a 2fa authenication before a tx is sent out
• Multi-environment key management: It's challenging to manage keys across multiple chains with different signature schemes, e.g. EVM and Solana. Steph wanted a "derive Solana key" precompile that helped manage that.
He actually seemed pretty excited to build this. In turn, he also invited us to his CAKE working group. He doesn't expect all that much to come to it, but he did note that it is full of people building multichain apps today. I told him we'd join the working group - there's a meeting in London this friday. I'm not around but can someone else go? Again, it's just to rub elbows and build relationships with all the multichain apps cc: <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U05BMHJMRNK>
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 13/03/2024 11:44:01 Z:
|   Ya I told ankit I will come Friday! But also down to jam in general. The ethwrspot people are in the working group and want to develop tx specific session keys on suave which I think would be awesome 
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 13/03/2024 13:21:36 Z:
|   super cool use cases
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 14/03/2024 07:56:42 Z:
|   Fwiw I mentioned similar use cases do vitalik and he was firmly against relying on sgx to store important keys. Instead he advocated for a “minimal keystore rollup” which is basically a rollup that posts encrypted keys and allows users to generate proofs from (idk how far away this is - just putting it out there)
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 14/03/2024 07:59:59 Z:
|   I thought the point of min Kv store rollup is not to store ur encrypted private key on but to set which key controls your account sort of like permissions management 
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 14/03/2024 08:01:45 Z:
|   Oh maybe thats how it works (i didnt go into details). The point was just that he presented as a much more appealing alternative
|   (Now that I think about it, encrypted key doesn’t make sense although I do remember the word “encrypted”)
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 14/03/2024 08:04:03 Z:
|   Yeah that was my understanding from what he said at dinner. But this would be cool to combine with Partha’s idea so you could make session keys like “key abc is allowed to control this one key for next 24 hours” 
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 14/03/2024 08:10:07 Z:
|   if you don’t use SGX how do you allow key delegation?
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 14/03/2024 08:10:39 Z:
|   You specify rules and then let people compute proofs that they satisfy the rules 
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 14/03/2024 08:12:36 Z:
|   but that doesn’t allow delegation right?
|   since delegation requires computation over shared private state
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 14/03/2024 08:21:05 Z:
|   Anyway would love more details from the Vitalik discussion, also, we could do SGX with threshold keys for store so k-1/N kettle hacks won’t cause leaking or non-recovery, and if want low latency we can have session keys without threshold so even if somebody rugs the user the loss is bounded
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 14/03/2024 08:26:05 Z:
|   On the threshold idea the comment was: “no way we’re trusting our PKI to a multisig” or something like that
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 14/03/2024 08:28:42 Z:
|   that’s fair for him to say
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 15/03/2024 17:00:13 Z:
|   ok maybe I’m too out of touch but just read <https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/minimal_keystore_rollup>, great for context on V’s idea

Some notes about a convo with Scroll. tl;dr:

• Was excited by
    ◦ Idea that you could constrain builders and prove that you didn’t do bad MEV
    ◦ Idea that you could gain more revenue
    ◦ The extra fault proof that you get from SGX to augment theirs
• Was concerned by
    ◦ Liveness
    ◦ Performance
• He told me they would be excited to work with us and are definitely interested
• Overall a good candidate for early adopting if we think we can stomach the integration cost upfront

|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 13/03/2024 19:38:35 Z:
|   I didn’t get to talk timelines - they don’t like shared sequencing because they think it’s not technically feasible
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 13/03/2024 20:21:34 Z:
|   not technically feasible on their own rollups or across different rollup stacks?
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 13/03/2024 21:03:13 Z:
|   Sorry - he thinks that shared sequencing probably doesn't scale to many rollups and doing it for reasons like "atomic composability" is overcomplicating things.
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 13/03/2024 21:57:05 Z:
|   ah yes, totally agree
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 14/03/2024 08:50:22 Z:
|   I talked to Jon last week, and he suggested Scroll as our #1 most likely integration partner (far ahead of optimism).
reasons:
• they are live but have little mindshare/adoption -> strong pressure to differentiate
• their positioning is to be the most secure + decentralized -> perfect match for what we offer
• they are already thinking about offering hack prevention -- e.g. they are working with the odysseus team rn -> another perfect fit for our hack prevention module
• they are the most open to SGX, because they are currently exploring provers in SGX as part of their core infrastructure. (we should dig if an even deeper partnership could be possible)
|   So -- very bullish on the idea of digging deeper with Scroll
|   And worth the integration cost in my mind

Looks like they fell for the marketing/PR hype trap instead of looking for real traction in the past - leading to them kept failing to find pmf. Seems like they are still making the same mistake - they got a lot tweet clout, did not seem to translate into any what I would consider real traction, and hence the recent pivot.
however they did accumulate a lot of up to date knowledge about the long tail rollups in addition to the big 5, and willing to share the knowledge.

Had a good chat with joe from wintermute at their london office. Worth reading the full notes here <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Wintermute-94ff885f618649f4986fd147dba2e68f>
• Joe is friends with Theo from merkle and thinks highly of their team. They’re searching for PMF, right now working on a telegram bot aggregator (“shoruken”) which sells orderflow to builders and sophisticated validator services like what titan is offering with chainbound.
• They are interested in execution tickets and want to keep their builder around in case it’s important for participating in innovations like this in the future. But, they would flat out shut it down if the meta is just orderflow. Not enjoying all the BD. They think ETs will be dominated by a few sophisticated actors, though the barrier to entry could decrease if the look ahead window is long (bc it’s riskier so prices will be lower).
• I proposed a SUAVE-based second price building system. They said they will use it if SCP does. In general they prefer a single neutral actor (“life was easier when it was just flashbots”; “we were fine when the neutral role got pushed to the relay but now even that isn’t neutral anymore!“). He asked about the advantages of SGX and suggested that the system needs some way to strongarm people into using it. The main risk joe sees is that there is often an incentive to deviate from a neutral provider.
• We also generally vibed about the state of the MEV-Boost market and where it’s headed. He agrees that the current trend essentially accelerates a worse market structure without actually creating better outcomes for the stat arb builders.
• They have some beef with mevblocker. In the past mevblocker have randomly shut off (very valuable!) flow, in ways that seemed to target WM. Joe also doesn’t like that the recent fee proposal requires submitting to agnostic.
• Interesting tidbit on team size: They have 3 people including joe on AMMs + the builder, 2 on RFQ/options, and 1.5 on something I missed.
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 14/03/2024 20:28:03 Z:
|   did you get any details on what titan is building for custom validator infra?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 14/03/2024 20:33:43 Z:
|   Joe didn’t say more in this meeting
|   
|   > Tesa [U06HLMRPYLV] @ 22/03/2024 11:01:43 Z:
|   Adding to the Wintermute notes from my meeting with Joe during DAS.

tldr;
• Builder <@U03PZSSETQA> 
    ◦ Theyʻre pretty open on what they are doing with their builder. It is very tightly integrated with their trading and their proprietary links between their trading set-up and builder limits their builder colocation ability (i.e. Bloxroute found builder-relay-validator colocation has the best latency).
    ◦ Their private network links are optimized so they donʻt plan on using Titanʻs relay. They submit to the relay closest to their machines.
    ◦ Any builder changes that they want to implement must be run through their compliance. They check OFAC sanctions list and have US employees but they do the bare minimum for compliance since philosophically they are against censorship. They check and update the OFAC list only once a month.
    ◦ They have stopped tinkering on their builder core and test experimental features with a small group of whitelisted vips.
• Trading
    ◦ They are a regulated entity in the UK and have a Singapore entity where they trade options and derivatives from.
    ◦ When they onboard an AMM as a counterparty, they KYC/AML the AMM but expect the AMM to do due diligence on their customers.
    ◦ They have internal threat detection tools that alert them of hacks. When a hack happens, they consider themselves a counterparty and will ping the AMM to let them know what is happening but stand by the trade.
• Institutional
    ◦ They are already in discussions with institutions on the order flow and validator side.
    ◦ Their OTC desk sees a lot of volume from funds / institutions. <@U03G59ZN90D> 
    ◦ There are a few crypto native funds that are click trading through metamask / Gnosis wallets.
    ◦ They have seen a few quant funds that are spinning up wallets to participate in degen trading.
• SUAVE <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03HT20PJES> 
    ◦ Only 1 dev on their team is a SGX expert. They prefer to wait and see how SUAVE is adopted. If SUAVE takes off, they will reprioritize it. 


> Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 14/03/2024 21:58:00 Z:
Talked to Titan:
• They told me beaver is launching a relay... but Beaver says they're just preparing in case they NEED to and they don't actually have a relay built (yet)
• When their builder went offline it was clearly benefiting beaver and when they came back online it was them who was eating into beaver. 
    ◦ They have no idea why they win sometimes
• They internalize their XOF from Bananagun with some "feedback" from their builder where they check to see if they think they'll win a block with it. If they will, they internalize it, if they don't they send it on.
• They see the game that this leads to and they don't like it. They are thinking of building an auction for their XOF, where builders bid for the right to execute orderflow. If they bid and win, but then lose the block, they are penalized somehow. To me it sounded like an RFQ system really.
• They are doing this auction for orderflow not because they think it's a winning play, but because they think it's the least bad thing to do. Otherwise, it's just a tit for tat game with other builders where they are super adversarial against each other and are trying to disrupt eachother. Or, all the value gets bid to 0 and even below as people subsidize orderflow.
    ◦ So, they are doing this because they think it'll smooth things out and they'll be able to focus more on what they actually care about - which is long term "infrastructure plays" to them
• They aren't interested in builder-proposer things like pre-confs, they seem pretty skeptical of those and of futures too. They interpreted rsync as going for that because rsync didn't have orderflow like beaver or titan.
• They don't care much for the Ultrasound shared sequencing stuff.
• He gave me a nice tip about an interesting staking project to look at called Puffer, where you could actually buy proposing rights ahead of time, a sort of execution tickets (!).
• L2s aren't really on their radar at all, super focused on L1. They're having a hard time keeping up with their relay, their builder, the BD, etc all now.
Will put in the CRM too!

Notes from chat with Taiko 

• Taiko client has 1000 line diff from Geth
• around 45 people
• Their primary focus is getting to mainnet (2 month timeline)
• Currently plan to be fully based rollup, seemingly because they haven’t figured out anything else out. They are open to suggestions for how to operate
• Blocks must be posted to L1 along with a commitment from a staked prover that the proof will be published in time. The entity posting the block is rewarded and responsible for incentivising the prover
• proofs run on 64 GPUs and take about an hour to run
• They are currently running their client in SGX and plan to use a combination of SGX and ZKPs at first to protect against prover bugs
    ◦ They like the idea of using SGX coprocessing given they are already running SGX
• They have a “boosted rollup” concept which allows for interop between multiple Taiko rollups (didn’t understand this too well)
• they have a meme of prover-proposer-builder separation they would like to create. They want to spend more time thinking about these markets in a testnet in about 8 months time

|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 15/03/2024 10:58:22 Z:
|   this feels confused to me or maybe I am confused myself.
how can they want _both_ be a based rollup AND have pbs?
if they are a based rollup, their blocks are already built by L1 proposers.
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 15/03/2024 18:26:35 Z:
|   Based first for simplicity and then later worry about about building a prover market
Notes from chat with linea

• They’re basically running Besu. The only diff is that they have a transaction filter that prevents transactions which do some forbidden operations (more than K hashes for example)
• They felt that there were too many shared sequencing designs that were too complex so they decided just to do their own thing (lesson for us)
    ◦ were curious about integration cost with suave and were pleased by low anticipated lift
• Looking at execution tickets as a clean way of handling PBS
    ◦ they would like to engage us in trying a PoC for this once they have their testnet in order
• Prioritising decentralisation over other features
• We indicated a preference that they accept all blocks from SUAVE. They were uncomfortable with this and suggested allocating some share of E.Ts to SUAVE builders.
• Primary feature of SUAVE they were interested in was user protection

super valuable signal. need more of this
|   did you by chance press here on the why they are uncomfortable with it? is it liveness? optics?

|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 15/03/2024 18:25:54 Z:
|   We didn’t get much apart from it “not being decentralised”. Simon immediately said “we can’t give suave exclusive order flow” so that was the framing they had

<@U05BMHJMRNK> Steph tells me he wants to build an "identity rollup" on top of SUAVE - basically, to help users manage their keys across many rollups. That's the context behind the ask for the docs.

He asked me some sharp questions about our roadmap and seems interested; he's also looking for a grant

Notes from chat with Fidelity -> <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Fidelity-17c264c0381d46daa100c11eca9a15fe>

tldr;
• Fidelity has ETFs but no funds trading crypto
    ◦ US entity not able to invest
• 2 crypto teams:
• quantitative team - 15 people (JM)
            • how would they allocate capital?
            • how to execute?
        ▪︎ post-trade analysis
    ◦ microstructure - similar to Galaxy research team
• 7 vc teams
• Event Ventures - invested in Ethena
            • invests in infrastructure and service providers (GlassNode)
    ◦ strategic investments are possible
• JM is from the quantitative research arm
    ◦ familiar with major DeFi concepts and is researching costs vs liquidity vs execution guarantees in DeFi (TCA in algo trading)
    ◦ speaks to block builders directly to gauge execution guarantees
    ◦ they use a model - foundational + systematic, to identify token and allocation size depending based on liquidity and slippage
    ◦ interests are in privacy, liquidity, execution guarantees, and slippage
• FB role in Ethereum ecosystem could use further communication
    ◦ Understands FB products but not where FB fits into the ecosystem (side eye whatʻs FB motive for open source products
    ◦ JM ask: What is FB goal from a mission perspective and what do we define as success?
Tesa
• quant arm experimenting in DeFi strategies and could potentially get allocation
    ◦ not able to trade → reputation risk + current financial opportunities > crypto opportunity
• interested in understanding execution process and how things are working
• not sure if they have a complete understanding of how to execute large txns and the options available to maintain privacy and access liquidity. ie. their research is Uniswap X and cowswap
• institutions could use suave (caveat regulatory ability) if it can ensure privacy + liquidity + execution
• execution could mean many things given how time sensitive the trade is
        ▪︎ liquidations / exit risk - higher execution guarantee needed
    ◦ position establishment / maintanence - lower time sensitivity → lower execution guarantee
Tina
• sees Fidelity relationship as investor; potential research collaboration based on what they need / FB needs
• need more touch points within Fidelity
• speak to Galaxy first

notes from chat w patty mccorry from arbi foundation:

• Arbitrum DAO is running mostly without the foundation’s involvement. Patty is not in most of the group chats and the foundation doesn’t have voting rights for now. There are many influential delegates (e.g. Olimpio which is some airdropfarmer twitter personality).
    ◦ DAO pays foundation who pays labs
    ◦ foundation mostly manages infra and upgrades
    ◦ DAO is lively and with many proposals and active delegate voting
• Large sums of money of money being thrown (e.g. 200m arb to gaming fund)
• ETHglobal focus is getting people building on stylus
• Lots of questions around SUAVE, but already understood broad strokes from the beginning
    ◦ “I assumed its a natural place to run things like CoWswap”
    ◦ He wanted to understand the relationship between consensus and kettles
    ◦ “How does BB work?”, ”How would SUAVE work if arbitrum sequencer were to use it”
    ◦ Doesn’t think we should be a rollup from an architectural standpoint (but I don’t think he had sufficient context)
• Thinks labs still wants to push for FCFS but realised MEV isn’t going away so want a minimal way of structuring competition in an acceptable way
    ◦ learnt their lesson with price feed spam
• Confirmed that sequencer is currently the bottleneck because everything is being checked against the fraud proving contract
    ◦ They have a fast rust sequencer and then also a slower sequencer which mirrors the fraud proof implementation and they execute against both (the slow one is in solidity I think)

notes from chat with Justin Drake 

• he really wants based rollups
• Titan relay
    ◦ taking a “wait and see” approach
    ◦ wonders if perceived lack of neutrality may play a role
    ◦ unclear if validators will connect
    ◦ working with Titan to see if they can help provide preconfs for rollups who want to be based
• No plans for ultrasound after execution tickets (which he thinks is agreed on as the most convincing path forward for PBS)
• Builders directly approaching validators
    ◦ doesn’t think they can offer much more than PBS market already does not too worried
    ◦ “validators are either conservative and unsophisticated” so slow in adopting in general
• Espresso
    ◦ views them as unaligned because of their token
    ◦ “one good thing is that they have a lot of money and people so they can write a lot of code”
    ◦ “you can use their tech without using their token”
• He perceives rollups as having uncertainty about the future and how they will capture value and reacting by trying to keep control over all levels of the stack
• Argues that atomic composability is cheaper than async because reverts have to be processed by the network in the async case
    ◦ doesn’t have great explanations for why composability is that valuable
• He thinks rollup challenges at the moment are
    ◦ concerns around bugs - if they go permissionless then anyone can exploit these (here SGX can maybe help)
    ◦ needing to transition from the trusted MEV protection of single sequencing
• “If Taiko is a based rollup, they will have $500B TVL because they inherit from L1”
• Plans to get arbitrum to be based by leveraging Arbi<>Espresso collab since espresso is in “based” camp
    ◦ Busy working with Steven “behind Ed’s back”
    ◦ Steven is open to interoperating with other rollups
• Thinks Espresso’s consensus will be too slow so we will still need cryptoeconomic preconfirmations
• Has a “stealth plan” to convince Optimism to be based and feels convinced he will succeed
    ◦ thinks shared governance, security and interop are the main features of the superchain and all of these can be achieved through based sequencing
• Scroll has not been very amendable to his attempts to make them based despite being an early investor and having biweekly calls
    ◦ Mo, Peter and Sam have been open to the idea
    ◦ Toghrul is coming around
    ◦ Ye and others are opposed
<@U03G0PNEV0E> Justin also mentioned DWallet as a much more convincing solution to “account abstraction” than what near is doing because of a better security model. This is basically strategic delegation I think - you should check dwallet out

Mark from Optimism is chasing me on their team getting a look at our work with the OP-Stack - he told me "hey robert just swinging back around on this bc its something that we are very interested in collaborating on" which is a nice signal!

I don't think (correct me if I'm wrong <@U05BMHJMRNK>) that we've made progress on the OP stack itself since the Nethermind PoC so we don't have much to show them. But they are an important partner - my thought is to schedule a call with them to let them know our general plans and see what they say.

I had a spontaneous chat with the Arbitrum PM
• Orbit is eating up the market (apparently) for a few reasons
    ◦ most competitors aren’t live
    ◦ OP doesn’t support chains to deploy with their own gas tokens. Apparently this is blocked by fraud proofs which require a huge refactor of code base
    ◦ Arbitrum has a ore organic ecosystem (most OP TVL is OP token)
• Arbitrum doesn’t do any ecosystem grants
• They see base as a big threat
• Infra
    ◦ Seems like Espresso is definitely going to be an option for orbit chains
    ◦ RaaS teams are currently running sequencers for orbit chains and charging 5-10K plus some share of sequencer revenue
    ◦ Arbitrum takes some fraction of sequencer fees as well (via BSL if not an orbit chain)
• other differentiator between Arbitrum and OP ecosystems: OP is going for freemium model in which anyone can run the OP stack for free but without support and less interop with superchain vs arbitrum’s BSL approach.
    ◦ The superchain approach also involves group bargaining with e.g. node providers for low fees etc.
• he views base as parasitic to OP more than beneficial
• Cost is a big factor in L3 design decision making
• They’re selling stylus as a “coprocessor”

|   • what’s the name of the arbitrum PM? are they in our shared group? 
• elaboration on why espresso will be an option for orbit chains? the orbit devs like them? orbit raas likes them? why?
• by sequencer revenue/fees, you mean arbitrum and raas providers (conduit) pocket the difference from the gas fees they charge from users and what they pay L1? not some type of more elaborate mev deal? 
• how does BSL work / play into their strategy? is it that the will be able to demand x% of sequencer revenue from orbit chains?
• what do you mean cost is a big factor in L3 decision making? cost of what exactly?

• he mentioned that its hard to build and run a consensus protocol. Didn't discuss much further
• yes not some elaborate mev deal
• yes they use BSL for orbit chains that don't deploy as arbitrum L3s and then take some of their sequencer fees
• cost of running their chain. They have to pay the infra providers who run their sequencer, indexers, RPCs etc

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 16/03/2024 14:09:39 Z:
I also had a chat with the hyperlane people which was interesting because I don't know much about the bridging space
• they are similar to IBC in that they have a framework that doesn't lock people in to any particular infra that they run.
    ◦ improve on IBC by being more generic - support more blockchains ("security environments") and do per-asset segmentation to decrease risk correlation
    ◦ differentiate from other bridges by not doing any kind of lock in 
    ◦ their framework can also wrap IBC/axelar etc if those are already deployed
• They aren't sure how to monetise because of this very open source model but are thinking of probably offering  message-relayer-as-a-service kind of offering 
• They're using eigenlayr to bridge info about ethereum to other chains
I wonder if we can't offer some kind of relaying service in the longer term as part of async interop between chains that are sequenced by suave

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Bonk-Bot-2b6a1c0f7dbc469188af6487593d0302|BonkBot notes>
Attendees: <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U05BMHJMRNK>

tldr;

Team
• Bonk bot didnʻt start gaining traction until December 2023 via SOL run, Jito airdrop, meme coins.
• They are a small team of MEV front runners / degens. James met co-founder after he was frontrun on Aori NFT. Kingsol is a brother of a Discord friend.
• 8 people → 3 devs, 1 intern, James, kingofsol (head of product), ops guy (kingofsol brother), sub-security person, caro (?) and one more dev about to be hired.
• They were not expecting their success and have no roadmap or analytics. They would be happy to give log data to FB data team for analytical help.
• Currently evaluating whether they 1) continue this project and add features or 2) they find an exit with the least brain damage as possible (Tina is brokering a deal).
• Worried about regulatory and will release a non-custodial feature in the next few weeks that should eliminate most legal liability.
• They have a separate Discord of power users and share pnl dashboards and new features with them first.
• They have never raised money.
• James views BonkBot as more of a wallet and the non-custodial feature they will add is further along this line of thinking.
• They were thinking of pre-funding wallets for new users but worried about sybil.
Bonk Bot
• Main focus right now is keeping the bot alive.
• <https://dune.com/whale_hunter/bonkbot> - 1% fee on trade value. revenue is 50% of actual.
• Bonk bot has no features. Their edge is that they come from the degen world in Solana and they have strong meme skills.
• They have weekly Twitterspaces where they feature tokens and then burn about $5k worth.
• Profit margin is 99%. All of their treasury and profit is in BONK and they havenʻt taken personal profit yet.
• Bonk Bot users set huge slippage when trading because they just want execution and view trade as either a 0 or a ginormous EV.
• Their customers are pro traders and retail that are just punting. Avg trade size is $10k+.
Solana meme coin landscape
• Solana is very culty with most traders in AsylumDAO. Unibot created a Solana version with more features than BonkBot and the Solana degens rejected it because it wasnʻt Solana.
• A cabal of CT Solana influencers determine which tokens to meme. They usually look for tokens that developers have exited and takeover the token and run the meme.
• Most memecoin teams are sketchy and not good people.
• Unibot Solana was created by a contractor team and Unibot has split from the Solana version.
• Solana bot is the #2 tg bot but itʻs known for wash trading.
MEV post-Jito mempool
• Jito still does bundle auctions. Solanaʻs priority is users which is why they told Jito to shutdown mempool because users were complaining of sandwiching.
• Bundle time ~ 200ms. BB could bundle similar to jaredfromsubway.eth and they are thinking of extracting the MEV and sharing back with their users.

<@U03GRQX5HGR>

tldr;
• hart wants to build across on suave. <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03HT20PJES> 
• he feels like building an encrypted order flow auction is the best use case for suave. <@U03G59ZN90D> 
• suggests that suave charge per app (similar to aws) and not for compute.
across
• l2 cross-chain bridging
• they want to deploy to all l2s and not specific ones
oval
• l2 auction of oracle updates
• the public receives the info free after a delay
• mev searchers pay for the faster oracle update
• chainlink isnʻt looking at l2. not worries about their new data service (pyth like)

• barriers to adoption for crypto dark pools / existing competitors. i think otc is the existing alternative, who operates largest otc desks and what are the primary benefits and pain points / concerns with trading otc.

Update on ImmutableX (from our investors at Parafi):

> Just chatted w/ Immutable devs re: MEV. Seems like they are much less in the weeds on that. Cognizant of some of the general MEV approaches, but they want to start centralized sequencer / PGA ordering and then decentralize a little bit to a constrained node set. Aren't spending time on MEV yet as it isn't a key priority. I'll keep in touch with them on it and keep you posted

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/GSR-64784a3edc124ff3b31833f9fd577812|GSR> - from DAS

tldr;
• GSR recently hired a new Head of Trading who is restructuring the trading desk. Rather than having specific traders, ie. DeFi only, he wants traders cross-trained on all strategies.
• They recently expanded strategies to Arbitrum but have not been able to test them since their DeFi trader, Till, is being cross-trained.
• They see each DeFi AMM / DEX as another price feed that plugs into their trading platform. When they add another AMM / DEX, they make the DEX go through AML / KYC.
• They are curious about SUAVE but during a bull market, their focus is more prop trading rather than expansion.
• Their Head of Trading is still ramping up on the different chains and the trading opportunities on each chain.

|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 22/03/2024 10:57:23 Z:
|   Adding from my notes:
• GSR is active on Polygon, Optimism and Arbitrum
• Last November at DevConnect, they had been working on a Ethereum mainnet block builder. However their effort stalled due to their DeFi trading team's DevOps jumped ship to SUI blockchain. Their DeFi trading team now only has Tim Neugent (developer), Till (trader), Andy (developer), Fred (BD). 
• They are also going through restructuring with the new head of trading coming in, meaning they will be unlikely to resume their efforts on block building or roll out new systems in 3 months. All integrations now maintained by this small team and they feel quite stretched thin. 
• Tim N is taking a 3 week vacation starting next week - worked through holidays on the builder. 
• They are willing to build on SUAVE or tinker with it when we re ready, a 1-2day hackathon where they get their hands dirty should be good.  
Take away:
• their teams edge in MEV supply chin is on L2s
• they take a conservative approach to MEV trading compared to Wintermute: they have hundreds of tokens they market make on CeFi exchange, their main defi strategy is LPing on pools and arbing, their strategies on L2s are different on each domain (Arbitrum is the latency game, Optimism is arbing?, Polygon had to work with validators and reorg protection).
CTA:
• we can leverage their DeFi trading teams down time to learn more about their live player experiencing searching on L2, esp optimism, both from data and from microstructure <@U06HLMRPYLV> <@U03HT20PJES> 
• we should nerdsnipe them to tinker with SUAVE when ready <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03PZSSETQA>

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Odos-0af07b703f3f4f439231a5d5e7bbf7ea|Odos> - from DAS

tldr;
• Odos started as a smart order routing platform and is moving towards solving and direct order flow through their UI / UX.
• They do not have inventory so arenʻt market makers but utilize JIT liquidity to fill orders.
• They recently went live on DefiLlama and their order flow 2x. It took them 11 months to get on DefiLlama.
• They have a new router which has a larger presence. DappRadar has more accurate data than Dune. <@U03G59ZN90D> need to update <http://Orderflow.art|Orderflow.art> with their new addresses
• They are partnered with Orbs for a solving as a service solution. Orbs was Odosʻ entry into the solving space.
• They are the only aggregator that does multi-token input / output swaps.
• They are not looking to expand into block building because their team is small. Also they have good relationships with builders. Preconfs and execution tickets would give them better insight into flow revenue.
• They do not have any plans for an exclusive order flow deal but have looked into it. They send flow to all major builders. Until they can quantify the benefit of an exclusive order flow deal they wonʻt pursue it.
• They view cross chain swapping as the future but havenʻt seen a solution yet that they trust. They require atomicity and Espresso is the closest but as an aggregator, they require higher security and trust. They donʻt want to pass those responsibilities to a third party.
Team
• Small team of 7.
• They have completed over 800 integrations to liquidity sources in 2 years. 1inch has 400 integrations in 6 years.
• They believe modularity is a layer of middle men that extract rent. They prefer to start with partnerships and then build in-house if it makes sense.
Future plans
• Future plans could involve creating their own intent system. They want their user experience to be seamless.
• Linea and Mantle are next on the list. Berachain, Kinto (Arbitrum KYC layer), Blast, and Scroll are being considered.
Market Share
• Most of their volume is on L2s. They are the number 1 dapp on zkSync by volume.
• They are decent on Base and Arbitrum and have ok volume on OP, Fantom, and Polygon.
• Most of their solving comes from api partnerships or UI on L2. The major solvers are not on L2s.
• Uniswap X is waiting for Odos to start market making to expand on L2s.
Product
• They are going live on CoWSwap in 2-3 weeks but Odos does not want to custody users private keys (future CoWSwap change).
• They are adding limit orders and gasless swapping to their front-end. They are looking for a partner for gasless swapping.
• Next on their list are TWAPs, iceberg orders, and user slippage controls.
AMM
• They need to create a custom solution for each Dex that they enter which creates dependencies.
• When looking at new markets, they look at the size of the market, the market presence, and calculate their projected revenue.
• 1inch staking requirement is demotivating.
SUAVE
• Alex is interested in operating a TEE kettle <@U05BMHJMRNK>

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Bebop-Wintermute-695fadcaf9af4414b32658163f736aa0|Bebop> - from DAS

tldr;
• Katia thinks there will be major changes coming to the aggregator space as trading moves cross chain. Players that will take marketshare will have really good tech or bizdev.
    ◦ 0x is becoming irrelevant. Trading a large universe of tokens requires a lot of resources.
    ◦ Paraswap has stronger routing and engineering and should survive.
    ◦ Lifi is really strong in bd.
    ◦ Hashflow has strong bd with market makers. They raised at the right time but considers their product underwhelming given a 25mm raise. Hashflow isnʻt multi token to multi token.
• Bebop is considering a TG mini app so that they can embed social and execution together. But self custody is the biggest issue.
• They want to make the best RFQ system and feel that their new smart contracts will be a game changer with positive slippage.
• Looking for a big name integration. They recently launched a partnership with Lido.
• They are looking to create a reputation system for solvers and want to shed light on the flow from quote-to-execution. Current problems are 1) slippage is not measured and 2) there are no records of quotes onchain.
• The major bottlenecks are 1) slippage varies for different coins, 2) the duration of live quotes varies, and 3) how to calculate trade impact from a DEX with no order book.
L2 thoughts
• Expansion into L2s is difficult since most of the liquidity is on Mainnet. Arbitrum is seeing more liquidity in ARB, ETH, and stables.
• Smaller market makers trade only 10-15 coins.
• Bebop is looking at Scroll and Katia likes the Scroll team.
• For cross-chain expansion, they will either need to use a messaging protocol or partner with a cross-chain project (i.e. Matcha route). They are looking to build a proof-of-concept first.
Team
• 5 engineers for Bebop. Wintermute < 100 people. Bebop is not too connected to Wintermuteʻs operations.
SUAVE
• SUAVE could potentially provide a solution for the solver reputation system but there is only 1 SUAVE developer at Wintermute.

Grabbed coffee with Stephane (Frontier), notes:

_*What he's been up to:*_
• CAKE framework was a more crystalized version of his old startup idea _onboard.money_ (end to end transaction management stack for better UX) before Flashbots
• Alfred (telegram bot) is primarily the Kolibrio team (based in Lisbon) they are advising them, but it's struggling in marketing
    ◦ I suggested to Stephane he should consider acquire/JV with Bonkbot - great at marketing, weak at roadmap/regulatory considerations. Steph thought it's a great idea
_*What got him excited about SUAVE:*_
• He got excited about the prospect of SUAVE when Robert/Dmarz described / gave him the idea that it's like but more than a shared sequencer, that can host and sequence rollup applications on top of it. 
• Within CAKE, he sees a major gap missing is the permissioning standardization. 
• He sees the existing JSON RPC specification for communicating with Ethereum nodes, written by Gavin Wood in 2014 as being old and not permissioning needs today. He believes there is a need for a new more expressive permissioning standard.
• What the new permissioning standard looks like he doesn't know yet. Currently the only project he knows of working on permissioning standard is <http://usecapsule.com|usecapsule.com> which lets you deploy all kinds of policies.
• He is excited about the programmability and liveness that SUAVE provides. He is interested to see what a permissioning rollup built on SUAVE, using secure enclave envrionment and ability to deploy arbitrary policies could look like.
We ended on a great note to jam more on market insights going forward. He will follow up with us in tg group on SUAVE collab.

_p.s. Steph was super impressed by <@U05BMHJMRNK> your work, your memes and your aesthetics/diagrams!_

Met up w Josh and some of the other Astria gang to catch up on their thoughts and talk about SUAVE integration.
tl;dr
• many good questions including how to integrate rollups in their ecosystem into kettles
• still very keen on having SUAVE be an option for rollups to “decentralise the sequencer”

> George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 29/03/2024 00:24:25 Z:
An ex-Robinhood friend is working on a project that aims to make market making more credible and transparent for projects, and potentially provide a means of coordination for market makers.

*Current Pain Points:*
• Lack of transparency: Market makers are black boxes, and projects don’t have visibility into their activities. Projects are unsure if market makers are acting in their best interests
• Lack of coordination in multi market maker scenario: When projects hire multiple market makers, there isn’t a credible way for them to coordinate with each other, potentially leading to inefficiency.
*Proposed Solution:*
• Create a credible platform that market makers transact through and custodies their token loan
• Give projects more transparency into what market makers are doing. For example, it could show exactly what market makers are doing. If the exact trading record is sensitive (revealing trading strategy), it could perform private checks on the trading logs to give projects the guarantee that market makers are doing the right thing
• Provide a way for projects to make credible commitments and coordinate with each other when hiring multiple market makers (e.g., in the case of Celestia)
I am sure there are many many holes here and there. If it is a salvageable idea, would it be something feasible and cool to build on SUAVE?

|   > Tesa [U06HLMRPYLV] @ 01/04/2024 12:45:43 Z:
|   <@U05DY4WTLUB> market makers wont like transparency because they often have inventory positions that could signal directional bias that would cost them money.
|   
|   > Tesa [U06HLMRPYLV] @ 01/04/2024 12:50:20 Z:
|   A better metric would be the buys to sell ratio (should be between 40-60% directional) , trading volume (to calculate % of daily volume), and the exchange should be able to tell what % of the time the market maker is quoting too.

|   Zora call went well, they're a chain focused primarily on NFT mints and only really primaries (e.g. there is no or little NFT trading). They have some interesting stuff like a "pre-mint" functionality where users don't have to pay for a mint to go on-chain but instead provide a signature and allows someone else to create their NFT mint in return for 10% of all revenue from it. Those signatures have a custom whisper p2p layer for them too. The mechanism for this might create MEV but it's not so bad right now, and they don't have that much erc20 trading MEV right now either. But they might in the future - in which case having an external builder is more appealing to them.

One thing for them is that they care about interop with other chains because they don't want users to know what chain they are using or even that they are using a chain. Ideally they can simply have a user mint a Base NFT with Zora ETH, or vice versa. So he asked me about external builders and interop and what we thought.

They were pilled by the notion of a coprocessor too, and there are Zora applications of that.

Probably not a good first user, but perhaps a good follow on user - especially if we can provide interop.

I talked to Hayden for awhile. They are working on a few things:
• [redacted confidential thing]
• Uni x v2 on mainnet: tweaking the system design to give users lower latency and better quotes
• Uni x on l2s: doing on-chain GDAs on l2s, same design as X on mainnet but on-chain and without the RFQ portion
• Uniswap extension: a wallet extension that was pretty nice
He was receptive to switching to Protect from MEVBlocker and liked the idea of getting priority fee refunds back to users, the only challenge he raised was that they are all heads down on the wallet extension and so the team might not want to lose focus. He agreed to follow up on it with their PM and EM.

• The partner is building a chain abstraction product and intent VM on top of SUAVE, recognizing it as the best way forward for their cross-chain vision. It gives them what they need and free them from rebuilding the wheel.
• They’re eager to work closely with us, deploying a “Session Key” on SUAVE to control smart accounts across all supported chains.
• Etherspot team is willing to lead the spec’ing of the entire pipeline and standardizing of interfaces for others to build on. It is the type of open source collaboration that enables permissionless and exponential growth of our community.
• Etherspot is going through a fundraising round, wants to highlight their plans to build on SUAVE, and potentially get angels from Flashbots angels. They want to know if they can mention on their pitch deck “building on SUAVE”
• Successful collaboration would make us a leading solution for chain abstraction and capture the mindshare of the sizable developer community that wants to build on chain abstraction solutions.
Technical Details:
• The Session Key deployment on SUAVE will provide the necessary signature for smart account control.
• While RIP 7560 (Native Account Abstraction) would supercharge this idea, it’s not a blocker. The partner can proceed with existing 4337 standard and services on SUAVE.
• It would require some basic solver operating on SUAVE.
Competitor Landscape:
• <https://particle.network/|Particle Network> (building their own Cosmos SDK L1) and <https://klaster.io/|Klaster> are working on similar projects.
• They’ve explored other solver networks like Khalani and Essential
Next Steps:
• Continue collaborating and building out the architecture spec and start testing it on SUAVE
• <@U05BMHJMRNK>: Send details to <@U02CJ9QVAL9> and <@U03FP0H62HH> for potential angel.

|   I’m excited by this and this use case in general! I’d be open to backing this team personally if that helps and I agree that it is a sick value prop that we could help these folks scale. It’d be awesome to have another team helping to drive “core suapp development” too. 

My one concern here is that I worry about us “crowning” one preferred partner and that scaring off other. As an example, Steph is actively building something super similar on suave! I’m not sure how to support both of them without annoying one or the both of them.

I pinged Paradigm to get their pov since this seems like a shared problem across similar projects

|   Would love to hear how this type of problem in general is solved!!
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 07/04/2024 10:59:53 Z:
|   agreed, in isolation this seems obvious to do, in reality its a little more complex. "developer neutrality" is important as well. curious how other projects have been doing this, e.g. eigenlayr
|

|   killer ty, last remaining Q is if we're okay with them putting "Building on SUAVE" in their pitch deck? I think it doesn't hurt to be okay with this on a case-by-case basis
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 09/04/2024 16:31:31 Z:
|   I mean, we can't stop them, no?
|   it's not like we can tell them to not use SUAVE
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 09/04/2024 16:32:37 Z:
|   We cannot, but I personally would ask us in this scenario (platform not totally public etc etc)
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 09/04/2024 17:10:57 Z:
|   Some quick relevant updates from the Etherspot team:
• They do not seek any privileged or canonical position and would love to build in the open, collaborate with other projects, like Frontier, and co-build a spec and standard.
• They have been the main organizer running the bi-weekly ERC4337 AA Core Dev Calls and would love to do something similar for Chain Abstraction on SUAVE, which could really help create a community of Chain Abstraction developers on SUAVE.
• They have already planned a meeting with Stephane to discuss areas of collaboration with Frontier.

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 10/04/2024 09:29:53 Z:
|   "building on SUAVE" seems great in the deck. its seeding the meme for investors that building on suave is the next buidling on eigenlayr (hopefully :p)

Quick notes from my HK trip - day 0 and 1:
Trading/Orderflow
• Jump and Tower are back in crypto, prop trading mostly, both through their Asia subsidiaries. Not yet back in DeFi trading, but likely soon. 
• Time Research (Bybit backed - we are already in touch) is quite good and underrated - ex tower people, pods like structure for trading strategies. 
• Dark pool analogy was an immediate effective nerdsniping narrative for non-mev tradfi people, they get it. 
L2s & DA
• Major CeFi exchanges all spun up their own L2s, many chose OPstack, no technical differentiation, most looking for marketing differentiation, two latest
    ◦ OKX - Xlayer
    ◦ Bitget - Morph
• One of the top Asia wallet Debank is considering launching a rollup soon
• Polygon Avail is launching mainnet in May with 10 key projects and they will allocate a % of Avail tokens to align interest; their head of strategy told me Flashbots collab is something they view of strategic importance down the road. 
    ◦ the guy was head of polygon strategy and Polygon studios before, we jammed on developer support and GTM with limited resources. polygon's playbook was quite good. 
• <https://0glabs.gitbook.io/0g-doc|0g Labs (ZeroGravity)> is a DA layer specialized for cheap AI model training, founded by CTO of Conflux.
AI (more see <#C050SSNC951|> channel)
• Sentient (Sandeep + Sreeram + a Princeton professor I forgot name), aim to solve model verification so to reward model creators royalties will be TEE based, some investors who passed on the project (400mil valuation) say it is at "verbalizing white paper stage" has unresolved technical issues wrt decryption.
• AI girlfriend usecase
    ◦ Myshell is an AI creator marketplace, with 1 million registered users and 50k creators. Education (20-30% users) and ai girl friends were main usecase. AI girlfriends service had porn issues before, and user retention is low, as users are not loyal to one "ai girlfriend" - got bored easily. 
    ◦ Established AI girlfriend companies found the most loyal paying customers are old people, divorced, those ngmi in the dating market. They love the imperfections in their AI gf and many hate it when they have a nonconsensual software upgrade ("My Cindy doesn't talk like that. I liked the way she was, I don't want her to be smart!")
    ◦ Notes from Tina: user data privacy is a legit blocker more sophisticated user entry, so is censorship resistance AI gf.

Our interviews with Asia market makers / trading firms showed some interesting potential early users for SUAVE:
• Amber Group - Aaron (prop trading - defi trader)
    ◦ background
        ▪︎ institutional MEV searcher
        ▪︎ active on most EVM chains
        ▪︎ formerly working on Goldman Sachs internal liquidity matching engine (dark pool)
        ▪︎ now do MEV searching (not cex-dex) + internal liquidity quotes for amber clients
    ◦ interest in suave
        ▪︎ more fair blockbuildiñg - don't trust sending flow to top 3 block builders, interested to help test blockbuilding SUAVE early and provide benchmark/feedback
        ▪︎ interested in dark pool usecase
• <https://www.liquiditytech.com/en|LTP> - Jack (founder, former Token Insight)
    ◦ Background
        ▪︎ self identified as the largest liquidity provider in APAC, 2nd largest prime brokerage in crypto (#1 hidden road, #3 falconX), account for 3% of total trading flow (???)
        ▪︎ the only prime broker touching defi (Hidden Road do so via enclave.market and others indirectly, both Hidden Road and FalconX cannot directly touch defi due to regulatory)
        ▪︎ lending to market makers and institutions, help them with cross margining
        ▪︎ $3-6 billion (???) per day volume, 2-3% is defi (cex-dex, dex arb)
        ▪︎ operate a small block builder on Ethereum (blocksmith), and 2nd largest block builder on BNB chain (#1 is Bloxroute)
    ◦ interest in SUAVE
        ▪︎ bullish on SUAVE dark pool usecase for block trades
        ▪︎ main pain point is counterparty risk
        ▪︎ want to be early users
looking forward to <@U06HLMRPYLV> 's much better readout + notes, above are my quick readout written on a taxi ride:smile:

|   Background
LTP started 2.5 years ago and currently have 70+ people.
People
• Jack - co-founder, ceo. Came from Token Insight.
Business
• They are the #2 prime broker globally behind Hidden Roads (FalconX is #3).
    ◦ Hidden Roads is US based and can not offer defi connectivity.
    ◦ LTPʻs edge is their ability to offer cefi / defi to their customers and their low-latency.
• Services: lending, cross-margin, and exchange / defi connectivity.
• They are 3% of total crypto volume (BNB, EVM chains, Mainnet) with 97% on cefi, 3% defi. They are currently assessing Solana.
• They have an asset management side that help new managers raise capital.
Customers
• Customers are market makers, family offices, funds from Asia (60%) and Europe (40%).
    ◦ 60% of their clients are crypto native. Most teams started in Defi summer.
    ◦ During the bear market, the mmʻs were unable to maintain their businesses. Mmʻs started returning during Solanaʻs rally in 2023 and are currently farming for airdops.
Builder
• They are looking at creating their own builder for their customer order flow.
    ◦ A lot of their customers are involved in cefi defi arb. Some clients participate in on-chain MEV and they want to provide more competitive execution.
    ◦ They feel that the top builders are run by mm and they want their builder to be neutral.
    ◦ For BNB chain, they currently build 9% of bundles.
• They believe they have new strategies for Ethereum builder that can help them win market share without subsidizing.
• They will have first execution for their customer order flow then will pass it off to top builders if they can not build the block.
SUAVE
• Interested in SUAVE for dark pools. They are currently speaking with 1inch about Resolver.
    ◦ Dark pools leverage their 1) flow with exchanges, 2) allow them to proprietary trade against their flow, 3) match flow with traders / market makers.
• Block trading requires liquidity and volume. Need to address counterparty risk and regulations.
• They think it will be awhile for institutions to start trading onchain. The biggest issues are
    ◦ their isnʻt enough liquidity during bear markets since most of the trading volume is done by retail traders.
    ◦ institutions need to know their counterparties (kyc / aml through the entire transaction lifecycle).

|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 12/04/2024 17:56:44 Z:
|   is my understanding correct: majority of LTP’s volume comes from routing customer trades? and their customers use their router because they have an easy interface/connectivity to cefi/defi liquidity. And their business is skimming a fee on top?
|   
|   > tesa [U06TUB9EW2Y] @ 13/04/2024 10:23:01 Z:
|   Prime brokers offer connectivity to various exchanges to their clients and offer cross-margining where off-setting positions cancel out (clients trade through the prime brokerʻs exchange account).  This allows funds to use their capital more efficiently and allows for the prime broker to lend to customers since they have an overview of customer positions and profitability.

Prime brokers mainly make money on the lending rather than transaction fees.  One of the selling points of prime brokers is lower trading fees since they can aggregate all their customer volume on an exchange and receive top tier fee discounts.
|   
|   > Xinyuan [U03G0PNEV0E] @ 13/04/2024 16:24:48 Z:
|   Great response, thank you!

Matrixport - Cynthia Wu (coo), Ben (head bd), Anson (head of custody), Jonathan (treasury)

tldr;
• Matrixport is a crypto financial services company started by ex-co-founder of Bitmain.
• Their main businesses are custodian services (Cactus custody), prime brokerage, and RWAs.
    ◦ Cactus custody is a fork of Metamask Institutional wallet and they run Blocknative RPC for private mempools. They are interested in MEV Protect for order flow rebates.
    ◦ Prime brokerage - they lend and cross margin to their clients and provide connectivity to cefi exchanges and defi.
    ◦ RWAs - they created a stablecoin USDv and are looking at remittances and trade financing use cases for Asia business overseas.
• Their customers are primarily market makers, family offices, and funds.
• Their main interest is in MEV protect - 1) provide MEV rebates for their customers (Cactus wallet), 2) avoid paying for failed transactions (Treasury).
• Their knowledge of Flashbot products is in the beginning stages as they didnʻt know about MEV Protect / Share. They are interested in learning about SUAVE but do not see a use case for themselves quite yet. No interest in privacy or dark pools yet.
Cactus custody
• Uses a fork of Metamask institutional wallet for their UI / UX
• Matrixport uses Blocknative for their RPC to send orders to private mempool. Started this a few months ago.
• They did not realize that they could earn a rebate on customer orders via MEV Protect. Asked for MEV Protect details and documentation
• Need a Chinese-speaking Flashbots contact to discuss with their tech
Treasury
• Spent over $2k on failed staking transactions the other day and wanted to know if MEV Protect could prevent this.
• Question - where do the fees go for a failed transaction (no cancel)? Does it go to builder / validators / burned?
• They asked how ETH staking yields would be affected if the MEV fees are directed back to users in SUAVE?
    ◦ Order flow originators benefit and take that portion of the MEV pie rather than the current MEV pie going to validators.
• They need to have their tech leads review MEV Protect.
MEV
• They are not quite aware of the order flow process → sent them to <http://orderflow.art|orderflow.art>
• Suggested that RFQs (Bebop, Uniswap X) would be useful since all their customers are KYCʻd.
• They did not realize that their order flow had value that they could offer to their customers and are excited to learn more how to capture this value.
New businesses
• They recently took a trip to Latam (Mexico and Brazil) and were impressed with Brazilʻs adoption and regulator flexibility. Word is a Brazilian CBDC is coming soon.
• In Mexico, they encountered many Asia businesses that want to remit funds back to Asia. Remittance is a major pain point mainly from dealing with foreign bank wires and the time delays associated with it.
• What type of companies?
        ▪︎ Asia businesses set-up in Mexico to build and export to US under the US-Mexico Free Trade Agreement.
    ◦ Asia businesses are in Brazil for commodity trading (soybeans, pork, beef, timber, minerals, etc.)
• They have created a stablecoin USDv to help with this but realistically it can be any stablecoin. USDv is on every EVM chain and will soon to be on Tron. Expect to be the #2 in stablecoin on Tron.
• SUAVE privacy is not really needed for this transaction
SUAVE
• Not really interested in dark pools at the moment. They are interested in mev rebates and protection from reverts / failed orders.
• They do a lot of non-swap transactions that are not time-sensitive and want to know how they can get them executed and if thereʻs a way that they could determine the probability of them becoming executed.

|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 11/04/2024 19:34:32 Z:
|   We’d much rather they submit directly to the Protect RPC. But, for completeness, I’ll note that technically speaking they should be able to access Protect (and its features like refunds / no failed tx fees) through Blocknative. I think they just have to add us as an option in their Blocknative config.

Cc <@U05DY4WTLUB> for chinese speaking contact :)

“Were do the fees go for a failed transaction” -> Nowhere. We prevent the transaction from ever landing, so they never have to pay the fees. (Some exceptions for special cases in bundles but don’t think that’s relevant if they just want an RPC).

Exciting to see the interest in refunds. Could be a good candidate for the pareto builder.

<@U06TUB9EW2Y> what volume of flow do their wallet and treasury products have? Do we have a way to label them in something like orderflow.art (maybe by router)? Would help gauge the size of opportunity
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 11/04/2024 21:53:17 Z:
|   Yes feel free to connect me! I know people of their venture arm. Would love to walk their tech people through Protect
|   
|   > Tesa [U06HLMRPYLV] @ 12/04/2024 05:50:42 Z:
|   The treasury flow is not related to swap transactions but mainly restaking and protocol rebalancing. 
I'll ask about an estimate of their customer flow.
|   What time frame are you interested in? Daily volume on Ethereum specifically?
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 12/04/2024 18:19:51 Z:
|   Restaking doesn’t have MEV but protocol rebalancing might. I believe Shea is mostly interested in transactions that have MEV and just overall priority fee paid by them. Yes on ETH!
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 13/04/2024 06:32:23 Z:
|   Any time frame really, just some sense of scale
|   
|   > Tesa [U06HLMRPYLV] @ 13/04/2024 07:33:33 Z:
|   If they forked metamask wallet , what is the best way to track this? Through their wallet address?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 13/04/2024 07:59:43 Z:
|   If they copied the swaps feature we could see if they have a router contract? <@U05578MHMUZ> 
|   
|   > danning [U05578MHMUZ] @ 13/04/2024 09:28:43 Z:
|   not aware of their router and cannot find by searching, can we ask for their router addr directly?
|   
|   > danning [U05578MHMUZ] @ 13/04/2024 09:31:46 Z:
|   ```Cactus custody is a fork of Metamask Institutional wallet```
i believe Institutional wallet usually means only restaking/rebalancing related.

Meeting with Pimlico:

• MEV: Vast majority of UserOps don’t have any MEV. 99.99%. A lot of gaming related usages which don’t have much MEV.
• Still one UserOp per bundle?
    ◦ When there is some big launch like NFT, there could be like 10-20 per bundle. Most of the time it is 1. Right they just do simple FCFS ordering.
• Frontrunning UserOps bundles 
    ◦ Definition: other bundlers inspect UserOps bundle submitted to mempool and frontrun with a bundle containing these UserOps but with higher fee instead. 
    ◦ Harm: Then the front-run bundle will fail on chain due to UserOp execution reverting (already executed) and make the bundler lose money.
    ◦ Motivation: They do it just to get the fee paid by UserOps.
    ◦ Use private mempool when needed to avoid getting frontrun.
• What do you feel about shared mempool?
    ◦ Recently launched on Sepoila.
    ◦ Feel fine because don’t plan to make profit on bundles anyway and RIP-7560 Native AA will make it redundant anyway.
• What do you feel are the promising directions of monetization right now?
    ◦ He completely skipped it :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
• On competition landscape
    ◦ Everything is open source but people often don’t want to run it themselves. So pretty standard SaaS business model.
    ◦ Expect big initiatives from L2 side to sponsor paymaster service providers.
• What do you think about ETH politics
    ◦ Rollups are gonna adopt native account abstraction RIP-7560.
    ◦ L1 will be a lot slower
• What looking for in SUAVE
    ◦ Selling Pimlico as a relaying technology for SUAVE to post tx on different chains. They already integrated with 40+ chains.
• Questions about SUAVE
    ◦ Kristof has concerns about putting private keys into TEE enclave, which is something we actually need for use cases like multi-chain support
    ◦ Can AA bundler happens in SUAVE? Under what condition would it make sense for it to be done in SUAVE?
    ◦ What are the kind of transactions that are on “SUAVE chain”?

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 24/04/2024 17:48:25 Z:
|   Thanks for the quick notes <@U05DY4WTLUB> . A few thoughts (thx <@U03HT20PJES> for jamming after!)
1. Medium term (12-18 months IMO) - AA and CA via SUAVE has market potential.
    a. Bundlers are orderflow to SUAVE, Paymasters can be a useful service provider for SUAPPs.
    b. Pimplico x SUAVE (pain points SUAVE may address): 1) ordering instead of FIFO, 2) reducing cost of reverts once multiplex becomes inevitable dominant play -  as market competition picks up for obvious best execution guarantees.
2. Short-term (6-12 months) Pimplico may be a potential GTM / orderflow partner (esp on L2s) for SUAVE
    a. They are live on 40+ chains with 7 people team, and understand the orderflow landscape within each ecosystem well (direct line with big players)
    b. While their GTM doesn't have any dependencies on working with L2 foundations, they are recipients of L2 grants, and their integration tactics seem to match up with ours as well - e.g. go to top ecosystems, integrate with Conduit. We can probably leverage player like Pimplico in navigating L2 political and orderflow landscape, and engage them as a SUAVE gtm partner.
3. We should explore how AA adds to the SUAVE narrative in our L2 GTM tactics, when we pitch their ecosystem and community. AA was high priority for some L2s, and having more "high priority" reasons to integrate with SUAVE is a good idea. 
    a. `Base` was noted as the most eager and technically capable to work with Pimplico - this checks out with what i heard that AA was a top priority for them, and it also makes sense Coinbase & Base team understand the orderflow and best execution side of things. 
    b. `Optimism` was noted to be up there as well, has its own Paymaster for users.  (I wanna learn more about why they do it) 
    c. We should definitely continue to keep the `RIP-7560` folks engaged and excited about SUAVE, they are deep with the L2 ecosystem, and can be added help on the narrative front and help L2 community get it. 
Funny how early AA is still but knowing the number of major orderflow providers prioritized it this year, the market will pick up (usually the adoption cycle lags behind at least 6 months in our space). IMO AA on L2 definitely has high growth potential, it's a matter of timing. 
• I would love to see us keeping a pulse on the AA adoption from data angle (cc. <@U03N9H4JP8C> <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U06HLMRPYLV> <@U05DY4WTLUB> )
• Would love to hear from our PMs on where you think AA on L2s fall in terms of our prioritization. (cc. <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03PZSSETQA> )

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 24/04/2024 19:36:38 Z:
|   I don’t think AA on L2 will be relevant to the L1 team this quarter. The L2 folks may have a different priority though

|   • 1. yes would love some type of monthly or weekly updates on AA adoption
• 2. I think its very relevant for L2 work (Mark updated interop spec to work with EIP 3074 this morning) but prioritization is a bit fuzzy for me because its hard to tell how soon things will get adopted. NEAR multichain accounts + Celestia ZK accounts got me a bit more excited <https://x.com/hdevalence/status/1782484276724060248?s=46>. Also Etherspot (pimlico competitor) wants to create a session key standard on SUAVE so you can delegate your acct to a private key on SUAVE for X assets and Y number of transactions

|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 24/04/2024 19:49:54 Z:
|   Also we have been asked by two people to support RIP 7560 <https://x.com/doganeth_en/status/1767312296122958097>
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 24/04/2024 21:36:24 Z:
|   <@U05BMHJMRNK> can you share a bit more on Optimism's update to the Interop Spec to support EIP 3074? did you chat with Mark about it?
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 25/04/2024 09:53:12 Z:
|   One important context to keep in mind is that:
• Right now in terms of the AA tx traffic Pimlico gets, in Kristof’s words “99.99% of them don’t have any MEV”
• Banana gun is building their AA stack entirely in house themselves because they don’t find 3rd party SaaS reliable enough to their standard as trading platform and they hate resolving technical issues through support.
All the GTM angels are super :fire:
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 25/04/2024 10:07:04 Z:
|   I will figure out a way to do weekly or maybe bi-weekly readout for AA related stuff. Sounds like a good MR project to have.

Intro meeting with Anagram:

Anagram is a vc studio - they build, incubate, advise, and invest in projects.

1. Build - they have 4 builders including the lead front end engineer (Jon Johnson) from 0x that built Matcha.
2. Incubate - they incubate 4 teams for a year.
3. Advise - they provide legal, labor, and advisory services in exchange for tokens.
4. Invest - they invest in early-stage pre-seed and seed projects and target cutting edge technologies.
Team:
• <https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-johnson-92269322/|John Johnson> - front end engineer. He was the founding engineer for <http://Matcha.xyz|Matcha.xyz>.
• <https://www.linkedin.com/in/robgbenson/|Rob Benson> - vp engineering, product & design. Contributor Osmosis Labs and CTO of Lightstep.
• <https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-eagan-22531577/|Joseph Eagan> - co-founder. Former coo and president of Polychain Capital.
• <https://www.linkedin.com/in/calilyliu/|Lily Liu> - co-founder. Ex-president of Solana Foundation and contributor Osmosis Labs.
• <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjalicea/|JJ Alicea> - product & research analyst.
• <https://www.linkedin.com/in/austbot/|Austin Adams> - principal engineer. VP of devops engineering MSCI.
<@U05BMHJMRNK> they are interested in building a SUAPP.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 28/04/2024 16:33:32 Z:
|   My understanding is Anagram is more Solana focused? Interesting the Matcha crew went there. Do you know what teams they incubated? 

Overall, SUAPPs are still early for us, collab with venture studio and VCs is something that can help us scale, and target specific quality development teams, once we get closer to the stage. For now, let's put them into our CRM.

(Side note: I am personally quite close with Lily Liu (she was COO at Osmosis, then Solana president) - we hang out in HK and I may visit her new home this year. Happy to explore the angle when SUAPP become a focus down the road.)

Meeting with Eugene from Ellipsis Labs (Phoenix - Solana):

tldr;
• Ellipsis Labs operates Phoenix, a decentralized order book DEX on Solana. They run their own market maker and all market makers on their platform need to be profitable (no subsidies). Phoenix hasnʻt been affected by Solana congestion since they match orders off-chain using ZK.
• Ellipsis looking to build their own L2 SVM to deal with the performance issues that they have had on Solana. Solana canʻt handle congestion and the current patch solution isnʻt working.
• Eugene is interested in learning about SUAVE but thinks adoption will be difficult without a strong builder and wonders how FB will recover market share. Also curious how FB will support SUAVE post-release since he believes FB needs to be an active operator in order to maintain competitive edge.

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 28/04/2024 16:41:27 Z:
|   <@U06HLMRPYLV> FYI - on our side <@U03G0PNEV0E> is super close with Eugene, a few of us also have decent personal relationships with them. He is a well known MEV searcher, and a known "PBS dissenter" with many of the non-alignment anons. His partner is founder of Succinct labs, who gave a <https://youtu.be/G0nFyq9DDPw?si=CsJthBVqpPN4-_B2|great fun talk on intents and SUAVE> at DBA Research day last year - though her view on SUAVE may have evolved as the space have.

Personally I dont think SVM L2s are of strategic importance for SUAVE yet. Ofc I would love to see how our SUAVE team think about our prioritization.

Caught up with our hackerhouse friend AFK from formerly Mantle now research engineering at Eigenlayer (and still advisor to Mantle). Created a telegram group to consolidate our SUAVE L2 collab explorations <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U06TUB9EW2Y>.
• Mantle is looking into decentralizing sequencers now, so may be a good timing to explore collab.
• AFK believes Jinsuk is the most well versed technically on what Mantle needs. 
• I asked about protocol upgrades at Mantle how it works since Mantle is a DAO. AFK responded - it needs voting, but the folks she pulled into the tg group are the key stakeholders in such decisions. 
<@U05BMHJMRNK> lemme know how you wanna take it next step.

Talked with Socket (who created bunge.exchange, the top bridge aggregator):
• they are pivoting to chain abstraction instead of bridging
• their experience as an aggregator is that users feel as if they are responsible for security even if they are not, so they want to vertically integrate
• they were interested in prio fee refunds, but right now they don't send bridge flow themselves - the bridges do. when they release bungee v2 they will send txs themselves, so it is interesting then
• they do multi-chain OFAs for their chain abstraction protocol and are looking for solutions - they wanted to talk to evaluate SUAVE, told me they'd do more research and come back to me
• they see shared sequencing as nerdsniping people on twitter but not being what people actually want
• they see agg layer as competitive to us

Symbiotic call:
• they are a restaking protocol (a la EigenLayer)
• founded by security researchers who worked with consensus protocols for awhile, Polkadot after that
• they are trying to be as governance minimized as possible and as a neutral as possible as a protocol
• they are looking for ideas of what people will want restaking and guidance on who is legit or not in MEV from US
• they were keenly interested in preconfs as a use case
• they are interested in having SUAVE validators be from symbiotic (we purchase shared security from them)
• they were excited by the idea that I had on the call of kettles being run by their operators, they could prove liveness faults as well as maybe proving privacy leakages too and slashing for that - basically, someone somewhere stakes some ETH and a kettle appears for them, and they have a guarantee it'll be around plus it'll be run by a high quality infrastructure provider
• they are looking for partners to make demos with, I think they'd do a preconfs for L2s demo or a "restaking for SUAVE kettles" idea
I thought the kettle idea was interesting as a use case, we should consider restaking for that as an idea for some kettle operators in the medium to long term (not sure if it make sense to choose Symbiotic specifically, but generally), which makes some sense to me in the context anyone being able to effectively "summon" a new kettle and know it's run by someone high quality and not a guy with an SGX sidechannel lab.

Whenever we get around to the problem of "who runs SUAVE validators" we should also think a bit more about restaking - tho again this is not a short term thing for us.

Final thing is that this is another case of "highly incentivized party that will make demos with us for marketing." Their expressed business goals here are: 1. figure out who wants to use restaking and cultivate that and 2. marketing.

|   my 2cents on TEEs + restaking: they are competitive ideas much more than complementary.
this should be even more clear after the EIGEN announcement where they want to go into  optimistic services + prediction market on top to resolve subjective faults. whereas TEEs are pessimistic technology (like ZK), restricting what actions service providers are allowed to make

I met with Viktor from Coinbase to talk about how we can best involve them in our upcoming product plans in 2024. He was v bullish pareto builder and had a bunch of good tactical suggestions on how to prioritize and pitch things

Tl;dr
1. Coinbase wallet and exchange would be very keen on monetizing through the pareto builder and we should pitch them with our data, wallet being hungriest of the two
2. They generally shy away from running any MEV infra and would only do this if it were necessary to achieve some important goal for UX or decentralization
3. He isn’t worried about their staking business rejecting the pareto builder, they accept that rewards will go down especially if it improves user outcomes
4. Base will likely care less about monetization and more about ways to grow their ecosystem; coprocessor meme is stronger than “2x your revenue” meme
5. Down to jam on TEE boost down the line

One other thing to note is that apparently viktor’s role as an advisor to flashbots seriously bans him from doing work on related projects internally. Which seems kinda counter productive, because he can’t actually directly work on things that involve us beyond advising. Not sure if this was already apparent to us <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U02CJ9QVAL9>

|   This is acknowledged and discussed.
• Ben (the other protocol specialist) is fully onboarded and super aligned, he is as effective and impactful on actually getting us what we need as Viktor. I have a great line of communications with Ben - we were chatting about stuff as fresh as yesterday, and he is a great contact we should tap into, based in NYC, and you know him too!
• historically Viktor has been more helpful in strategizing and ecosystem influence (advisory, twitter stuff) which is not impacted by Flashbots.
• with Viktor + Ben, I am pretty confident we can push things forward as effectively and perhaps more so because we have two angles.

• In the PBS/MEV-Boost ecosystem, Ben is the only person at Bloxroute that is seen as responsible, reliable and trustworthy (he's also been the only one shipping actual post-mortems, and being there on incidents)
• *He's leaving Bloxroute with end of next week, and starts as VP of Engineering at BTCS* (small team, publicly traded, "ton of growth potential", running a builder with a ton of subsidies)
• He's been complaining about dysfunctionality at Bloxroute engineering team level for a long time
• It's a blow to Bloxroute, internally and externally - they loose one of their top engineers, and the PBS ecosystem will be sad about them loosing their one honest and reliable representative.
• He's offered to help us improve our relay latency, and has a bunch of ideas (and experience)
• Sidenote: he's very unhappy about the Ultrasound team after several collaboration attempts, and feels the US team is pretty hostile.
• Ben thinks a relay enforced/backed OFA would probably be the best funding mechanism for relays
• He/they are also in talks with SCP, about SCP wanting to change the builder meta, and he seems to be pretty informed about SCP's ideas and requirements on that front.

I wonder if there are ways we could align him / BTCS closer with our plans

|   Their website lists staking as a service, builder+, and validator running.  They also donʻt seem to generate too much revenue annually and are a listed on the Nasdaq.  Iʻm not sure if they have order flow (it doesnʻt seem that they have proprietary trading but there maybe a corporate relationship that isnʻt known) or understand the order flow requirement to be successful.

<https://www.btcs.com/>
|   They generated 4.8% in revenue (1.3mm) on total assets of 27.1mm.  Thatʻs not great.
|   They should be hedged and earning carry on those assets.

|   The “run a builder with a ton of subsidies” approach is unfortunate. I’d love if we could find a way to work with ben to focus on something that seems more productive (and won’t waste them a ton of money…)
|   I’d also be curious if his departure impacts bloxroute’s aptitude and appetite for investing more in block building internally?

We’re tracking possible ways to engage with them via pareto builder cc <@U02CJ9QVAL9>

sorella labs - yuki, will
fb - <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U06TUB9EW2Y> <@U05DY4WTLUB>

tldr;
Brontes:
• Brontes faces minor debugging issues and front-end merging but is on track for release by the end of the week.
• The open-source launch is scheduled for tldr conference and will have only mainnet data.
• The codebase for Brontes will initially be maintained by Joe. They plan on hiring a developer to maintain and interact with the community and also be in charge of grants.
Data: <@U05578MHMUZ> <@U03N9H4JP8C>
• Brontes is not connected to L2 data yet and will probably post this as a grant for the community to do.
• Will estimates it would take 3 days of dev work to integrate with Optimism stack but they are currently all hands on deck to launch.
• FB wants to verify data with Brontes since the feedback from searchers is that the best Dune dashboards for l2 atomic arbitrage is off by a factor of 10 (George).
Announcements timeline:
• Sorella Labs out of stealth at tldr conference May 16.
    ◦ They want to showcase and open source brontes at tldr conference.
• Brontes announcement 2 weeks after tldr conference.
• Engstrom whitepaper should be complete within a month.
Grants:
• Yuki spoke to Ken from Uniswap Labs last week. They are aligned in terms of open-sourcing brontes and having the community maintain it.
• Yuki does not know the size of the Uniswap grant.
• Any changes or update requests to Brontes would be outsourced to the community to fulfill as part of the grant process.
• Top areas that would require community help:
    ◦ Expansion into other l2 chains.
    ◦ Creating new inspectors like visualization tool around missed slots.
    ◦ Currently, the Brontes analysis tool runs on block by block basis, they would like to refactor it to run analysis on multi-blocks. This would take about 1 week to refactor plus testing.
Flashbots requirements:
• Baseline → Brontes needs to be an open-source database.
• Quality l1 data and good data hygiene so that everyone can use it.
• Align Sorellaʻs methodology as the basis for l2 taxonomy classification.
• Yuki wants to have community contribute to what FB wants once they have the grants nailed down.
Sorella strategic round:
• They are planning to raise $2-3mm from strategic partners. Yuki has already spoken to whales since he wants to lock them in for LP commitments.
• The round would be a bridge round with the price set as a discount (~50%) to their next series A raise.
Action items:
- [ ]  Tesa → share with Yuki / Will what Ludwig sent earlier in terms of grant request.
- [ ]  Review the initial request for proposals with Ken to make sure the form is still current.

Not sure how <@U05DY4WTLUB> compared the data? would love to check out the approach. me and <@U03N9H4JP8C> did a bunch of queries trying to compare but because the metrics & coverage are slightly between the Dune one vs Libmev we couldnt get a conclusion yet.

I'm in the process of validating the Dune L2 atomic arb data this week actually and got a sample from libmev a day ago. Will keep you updated our conclusion.

|   <@U03HT20PJES> it's called Angstrom (10^-22) - this is how their nodes come to consensus. I have more details from my HK meeting with Karthik on how Sorella labs work. will write it up.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 05/05/2024 14:02:29 Z:
|   Adding to <@U06TUB9EW2Y> 's readout, I wrote up a <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Notes-Understanding-Sorella-Labs-s-Angstrom-DEX-Sequencing-Ordering-4b090cdea0fc40cd9675ac4d92d2627d?pvs=4|Note on Sorella Lab> based on what I know about their design, team, timeline, consider we have concurrent strategic consideration with Sorella Labs.
_These are summarized from my loose notes from a few podcasts + meetings we had with them regarding the State of MEV data grant for their MEV-inspector codebase open source. Some of the notes may be slightly outdated though._ 
• They position themselves as a DEX sequencing or ordering layer (?) that sits on any layer.
• They are built on Uni v4 hooks and operate LP pools where they gate the execution right behind Angstrom. They will bootstrap liquidity by marketing to Uni v3 LPs (esp. whales and strategy partners, which they will align interest through their bridge round fundraising) and they believe OF will follow and that UniX, 1inch and other aggregators can route to them as well. 
• The arbitrage is executed by the searcher who provides the most value back to the LP. The rest of the bundle uses a frequent batch auction to find a fair price, with LPs only providing liquidity at that final price.
• Users opt into the trust assumption of just-in-time 2/3 signatures from Angstrom nodes, which does the sequencing and then submit it to the L1 for finality. There's currently little public info about Angstrom design, but I suspect <https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_/status/1757471352897122672?t=gNbtipk-ShU5nf28AfujMg&s=19|this> may be what they aim for...
• Angstrom initially uses the AVS as a quick way to boostrap ecosystem of nodes, there may be room for SUAVE collab in terms of hybrid or tierd security in the future.
• Their engineering work on Angstrom just got started as they had been distracted by Brontes work. They are primarily optimizing for throughput and latency, Angstrom v2 targets sub 50ms latency in order to be able to operate on top of fast blocktime L2s. They are definitely actively thinking about Chain Abstraction as well.
• Timeline: blogpost 1-2 weeks, whitepaper 1 months; going live depends on Uni v4 (e.g. Oct).
They are going public in 1-2 weeks and will make a splash in NY during Tl;Dr conference. *I think we should consider getting their draft blogpost, and align narratives, esp. on orderflow stack, and on L2s. <@U02CJ9QVAL9>* *<@U05BMHJMRNK>* *<@U03HT20PJES>* *<@U03PZSSETQA>* *<@U06TUB9EW2Y>* *<@U03FP0H62HH>*

|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 06/05/2024 20:07:16 Z:
|   Yes clear overlap with a lot of our ideas. It could be interesting to pull them into our bulletin chain work since that sounds like basically what they're running
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 06/05/2024 20:42:28 Z:
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> will assume you drive the collab unless otherwise instructed. Or do you want me to reach out?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 06/05/2024 20:45:01 Z:
|   we have a tg chat with them, will add you in there. that said, just to confirm - your primary interest at the moment is to explore potential collab on SUAVE design, or finding out more details about Angstrom design?
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 06/05/2024 21:14:45 Z:
|   yes...
|   I want to see what surface area for technical collab is esp since I think we are working on similar problems so no need to reinvent the wheel
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 06/05/2024 22:02:34 Z:
|   okay I just coordinated with Yuki to figure out who's the right person on Sorella's side cuz Ludwig had in the past been reluctant to share openly (seemed to be a personality issue not reflective of their team). Given they have a small team, here's the treasure map to their social graph, given we have 3 different potential collab:
• *SUAVE r&d* <@U03HT20PJES> - exploring the surface of research collab
• *State of MEV 2024 initiative* - we are coordinating an ecosystem grant for Brontes codebase open sourcing with UF + PBS F and joint PR <@U06TUB9EW2Y> 
• *L2 MEV quantification (for L2BB GTM)-* looks like Dune data is very off, Libevm is closer, Brontes is supposed to be the best. I may try to accelerate Sorella running an OP node asap, or coordinate. 4d chess getting them to help L2 data scientists get it set up... <@U06TUB9EW2Y> <@U03N9H4JP8C> <@U05578MHMUZ> 
*WHAT MATTERS -> Yuki is our point person for all collab...*
• Yuki is doing "research" but really strategy & PR, he's the Sorella internal advocate for flashbots.
• Will is the most valuable player to our collab because:
    ◦ Sorella's Angstrom architecture and consensus design is Ludwig + Will, Will is a lot easier to deal with and much more open imo. Yuki can loop Will in when needed. 
    ◦ Brontes (data) is mostly Will + Joe on their eng team.

|   My gut tells me they will be more competitive than collaborative with us. I think there is substantial overlap in users and use cases. In some world we work together and go to market for a bunch of stuff with them building on suave. But I think that’s not very likely given they are building a turbo fast custom consensus and corresponding chain 
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 06/05/2024 22:37:01 Z:
|   From my understanding they don’t have the resources to build a fully custom consensus engine any time soon. 
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 06/05/2024 22:39:56 Z:
|   To be clear, I think the research collab wpuld only make sense if it motivated them to build on suave - not sure if they would add much to our r&d efforts
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 06/05/2024 23:03:33 Z:
|   They are presently focused on v1 of Angstrom consensus + node set up, and they just wanna make sure it actually works. as mentioned they are bootstrapping security via Eigenlayer avs.
Angstrom v2 they may consider <https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_/status/1757471352897122672?t=C1w8saSioLYo_UI5vap_4w&s=19|leaderless auction> design. 

I am not sure whether we may collaborate or clash down the road. In Ludwig's eyes they may be competing with Flashbots along with all top projects, but his team does not seem to agree with him and he is now taking a step back more focused on marketing. 

Regardless intention, I agree with <@U03HT20PJES> in exploring the collab surface. We need to be in the know, of our own positioning and synergy with alt solutions. 
Their team's strength is depth within mev game, their infra is significantly better than Libevm's (and it shows in data infra already). They are actively thinking about the same target market esp L2 focus, but in near term imo we need to be able to anticipate what they will say, and make sure we can articulate a differentiate SUAVE value prop regardless what buzz they can cook up. Given our shared target audience and investors, and overlapping timeline with GTM, we will need to be mindful of their narrative just like Titan's, and preempt this. A first step to articulate our positioning, is to understand exactly what they are designing, then we can think about our strategy here.

They are smart - they originally started out similar to Arrakis, and then thought about building their own dex, then pivoted to build on uni v4 hooks because they see no point for them to compete in a front end game. If they see no point competing, they will likely be happy to build on/with SUAVE.

I looked at a bunch of the top gas-spending EOAs to identify sources of orderflow for the pareto builder. The next step is to get in contact with them and pitch them. This database has a list of all the accounts that appear to be over-spending priority fees. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/cfe0dfe8c07b4d5fb6b67a9b8ea9a057?v=017fc2fb580e4b49ace919520a0a696a>

|   I want to make sure I understand the why and how of what you are looking for. It's extremely difficult in a hundreds and thousand people org to find the right pm without knowing exactly what we are looking for. note the person who's responsible for the contracts technical decision, is most likely not the one making orderflow decisions esp if it's exchanges... let's be very mindful I don't want to waste our precious pm mindshare - any single exchange you are likely needing to invest in 2-10 hours of time each target (at least!) to get anywhere close to what you need. 

if we wanna use these as talking points to get intro to explore future relationship with these key accounts, that will be a separate approach - I suggest we convene and actually have a key account strategy (I'm highly skeptical of a conventional key account approach given our target audience). 

1. where can I find the thread of investigation of over-spending priority fees? in particular, how we identified the problem. In the past pre-flashbots days <@U03H6U5F200> and I did these sort of investigation + finding gas guzzler project collabs, but I think it's often hit or miss. 
2. evidence and value prop? -> this can help us narrow down who may be the kp within the org, and how they will prioritize. 
3. what does success look like via these convo with exchanges? 
the clearer we can answer these questions, the better I can tell you how we can meet the goals, and what it takes to execute without detracting from priorities, and how we can play like a team: product + market research

|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 06/05/2024 14:50:16 Z:
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> per your questions

1. The methodology is described at the top of the doc (see description for the table) <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/cfe0dfe8c07b4d5fb6b67a9b8ea9a057?v=017fc2fb580e4b49ace919520a0a696a&pvs=4|https://www.notion.so/flashbots/cfe0dfe8c07b4d5fb6b67a9b8ea9a057?v=017fc2fb580e4b49ace919520a0a696a&pvs=4>
2. The doc also includes evidence of the total monthly gas spent by each EOA as well as individual examples of transactions that appear to have overpaid. A value prop we are offering is that these EOAs could get refunded a portion of that value.
3. Success ultimately looks like them sending all transactions from their EOAs to the pareto builder (likely via the Protect RPC). We would want first right of execution, ie they don’t share with other parties.

I have lots of 2step connections to Robinhood, Gemini and kraken but I'd categorize them as only 1 step better than cold outreach. If we have no better option lmk and I can see what I can make happen. 

Do we know who the right person is? Can you give me a more specific sample message/ask that they can route?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 08/05/2024 16:26:01 Z:
|   Don’t know the right person but willing to pay the connect the dots game to make our way to them from wherever our best initial contact is.

The message is something like this:
• They control EOAs (accounts) on Ethereum mainnet which send high volumes of transactions
• We have noticed that the transactions sent by these EOAs may be overpaying for inclusion on chain
• In aggregate, this could amount to a substantial expense — for some, on the order of millions of $ a year
• We happen to specialize in this part of the stack and have a bunch of free software that they could easily plug into if they wanted to outsource this problem and recoup a nice chunk of revenue
• We’ve just noticed this based on some limited data we see on chain — would love to better understand exactly how their on chain setup works. If we know this, we could help get better estimates of the opportunity and suggest a path forward.
• No formal deals or anything — they’re free to opt in/out and test as they please
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 08/05/2024 16:33:34 Z:
|   (That is not the short thing you asked for, would want to workshop that based on the contact)

One other note while I am dumping context is that we want to convince them to send flow to us rather than just manually reducing their priority fees. What we’re offering is better than them doing it manually because
• If you do this yourself and screw it up you could impact inclusion speed
• We’re calculating these refunds at execution time so they’ll be optimally precise
But we might shoot ourselves in the foot if we say “hey just change that number from 2 gwei to 0.1 gwei” so that’s something to take into account when we reach out.

|   hi <@U03PZSSETQA> i know you urgently want to get feedback on the overpayment opportunity. Crowd sourcing Key Account contact from organization with thousands of people is not the best way to get the results you want. Here is my ask:
• Market Research team will own getting you _by next Monday_ at least 2 target from your list - finding you the right person, brief with the right context.

|   > *Potential roadblock in overpaying CEX orderflow:*
> We use a static policy and pay 2gwei priority as most CEX(eg. binance, kraken, okx, <http://gate.io|gate.io>) do, to avoid user’s bad withdrawal experience under extreme chain congestion conditions.
*OPPORTUNITY IN DISGUISE*
The suboptimal priority fee policy appears to be a stale and suboptimal CEX INDUSTRY STANDARD they can't explain!!! (I will validate this a bit further with OKX and Huobi folks).

What may move the needle in selling points IMO:
• Project how much they can make by saving on priority fees (esp in bull market)
• Clarify how easy the integration can be
• Clarify the low-risk for integration - emphasize the fall back to status quo
• Demonstrate ability to perform during market stress.
Bybit tend to pride themselves for being the _innovator_ in exchanges, we can leverage the war of attrition across Asian CEXes to tip the game and get them all. They may not be first real mover though but enough of a threat to others. Just like the mining pool devops engineer scene, Asia exchange wallet PM scene is small. <@U03H6U5F200> wdyt, flashback to MEV-geth days?

It would need to have at least a few other top dog CEX buy-ins though. For that we can also get our existing partner OKX interest as well. even if just for the signaling. <@U06TUB9EW2Y> Is OKX an overpayer? <@U05DY4WTLUB> are we in touch with OKX exchange wallet side?

*IF THIS POLICY STANDARD TURN OUT TO BE A BLOCKER FOR CEX*
CEX operate to make big money, and for things that requires a lot of work explaining to users, esp. if observability is an issue, they likely will not change. Don't forget we can still pitch Pareto Builder in other ways the CEX CEOs understand, e.g. dark pool.
|   
|   > tesa [U06TUB9EW2Y] @ 09/05/2024 06:35:34 Z:
|   Okx wasn't a big over payer but we can argue that its bull market and exchanges are seeing high volume which means there is more money being left on the table now than in a bear.

I would probably stress this to binance and coinbase too since coinbase reported Q1 earnings and they have all time high volume.
|   For both of their wallets, opt in should be good to clear regulatory hurdles and they can add the same services as metamask smart transactions almost immediately (depending on the internal explorer api).

|   <@U03PZSSETQA> they are quite professional 
my first instinct is 1) casually frame it as an alpha is the angle, alternatively 2) frame it as user research developing and adapting for exchange needs, when you respond docs later, and call first. both true. 3) is modified 2) give them something simple first then bring out point 2. some food for thoughts for ya <@U03PZSSETQA> 

a few questions for you so I'm on the same page. 
1. when would you think the earliest you can give them access to actual docs?
2. when do you want to have the stage 2 call, and what do you want to focus on in the call if we don't have material for them to read up before?
3. do we have a one pager or a short description that explains how we address their issue? 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 09/05/2024 19:27:02 Z:
|   Not sure what “stage 2” means but general agenda for a discussion with them
• Understand their on chain presence — how do they set up their accounts, what are the most important activities they do
• Understand their priorities — what do they care about when transacting, eg they mentioned speed is important for withdrawals, what about other kinds of txs, anything else they care about
• Snipe them on the opportunity — Show data on overall prio fees they have spent, other CEXes, verify other addresses we should look at for them
• Lightly intro pareto builder — they could just plug in our RPC today, we are going to add these refunds to it, any UX concerns they have about going through a private channel or how refunds work
• Then as follow ups we can share eg the redistribution math and links to queries they can test

Adding to <@U06TUB9EW2Y> 's readout, I wrote up a <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Notes-Understanding-Sorella-Labs-s-Angstrom-DEX-Sequencing-Ordering-4b090cdea0fc40cd9675ac4d92d2627d?pvs=4|Note on Sorella Lab> based on what I know about their design, team, timeline, consider we have concurrent strategic consideration with Sorella Labs.
_These are summarized from my loose notes from a few podcasts + meetings we had with them regarding the State of MEV data grant for their MEV-inspector codebase open source. Some of the notes may be slightly outdated though._ 
• They position themselves as a DEX sequencing or ordering layer (?) that sits on any layer.
• They are built on Uni v4 hooks and operate LP pools where they gate the execution right behind Angstrom. They will bootstrap liquidity by marketing to Uni v3 LPs (esp. whales and strategy partners, which they will align interest through their bridge round fundraising) and they believe OF will follow and that UniX, 1inch and other aggregators can route to them as well. 
• The arbitrage is executed by the searcher who provides the most value back to the LP. The rest of the bundle uses a frequent batch auction to find a fair price, with LPs only providing liquidity at that final price.
• Users opt into the trust assumption of just-in-time 2/3 signatures from Angstrom nodes, which does the sequencing and then submit it to the L1 for finality. There's currently little public info about Angstrom design, but I suspect <https://twitter.com/_Dave__White_/status/1757471352897122672?t=gNbtipk-ShU5nf28AfujMg&s=19|this> may be what they aim for...
• Angstrom initially uses the AVS as a quick way to boostrap ecosystem of nodes, there may be room for SUAVE collab in terms of hybrid or tierd security in the future.
• Their engineering work on Angstrom just got started as they had been distracted by Brontes work. They are primarily optimizing for throughput and latency, Angstrom v2 targets sub 50ms latency in order to be able to operate on top of fast blocktime L2s. They are definitely actively thinking about Chain Abstraction as well.
• Timeline: blogpost 1-2 weeks, whitepaper 1 months; going live depends on Uni v4 (e.g. Oct).
They are going public in 1-2 weeks and will make a splash in NY during Tl;Dr conference. *I think we should consider getting their draft blogpost, and align narratives, esp. on orderflow stack, and on L2s. <@U02CJ9QVAL9>* *<@U05BMHJMRNK>* *<@U03HT20PJES>* *<@U03PZSSETQA>* *<@U06TUB9EW2Y>* *<@U03FP0H62HH>*

Chatted with Dogan at Clave who has been a SUAVE fan since experimenting at DevConnect.
• Clave: Mobile Transfers and Swaps with no fee, no need for gas, and utilizing Paymasters. Only on ZkSync which has a specific native account abstraction similar to 4337 with small differences at the interface level.
• Essentially a Daimo competitor. Daimo only focused on stable coin payments where as they are swaps, and yield soon. Incubated in the ZkSync ecosystem but just raised a few mil and expanding to others.
• UX is very clean, he sent over a few codes for free $5 if anyone wants.
• As a consumer wallet they are interested in interop between chains, "no real solutions, all marketing". Want to "one-click" enable interop like they can spin up paymasters and other infra,
• Hyped about aggregation to bring down costs for them and maybe add interop. The aggregation interop will be at the speed of ZK though so even longer timeline
• 7560 lost momentum because of discussion around EIP 3074 on L1. Core devs on L1 started pushing 3074 more because theres still a lot of EoA users and want to improve the experience for them first. 
• "Are 3074 and 7560 incompatible?" If you do 7560 then everything becomes smart account based but 3074 just adds an extra opcode to EOAs that allow smart contracts to initiate transfer from EOA.
• 3074 helps more L1 wallet businesses, 7560 requires significant wallet changes
• "If you were us, would you add 7560 to SUAVE?" Right now not even one rollup has it. Should find a way to achieve native account abstraction. Good way to approach is following along with AA stuff because it’s moving fast, such as 4337 has a new PR to include a 3074 style transaction into.

|   Nothing to do right now. Dogan is a good signal condenser for info going on in 4337 + related abstraction EIP discussions. Re:SUAVE, if we want to play well with CA/AA devs then we need to make sure we follow a standard that known smart contract based wallets support.

I'm coordinating the follow up to the Paradigm / Flashbots strategy sync last week, here's the tl;Dr:

We provided update on the main priorities from the Flashbots Offslack, emphasizing the L1 BB (Pareto Builder) and L2 BB (GTM focusing on OPStack), and identified what Paradigm can help the most in each:
• *L1 Block Building*
    ◦ *`Pareto Builder`* is in full-on shipping mode 
        ▪︎ -> _what Paradigm can help on is technical advice._
    ◦ *`TEE-Boost`* timeline was discussed
        ▪︎ -> _Paradigm showed interest in helping to accelerate by designing/implementing it, and build narrative_
        ▪︎ _-> Georgios does not seem to know about TDX, we may want to get him nerdsniped ;)_
• *L2 Block Building*
    ◦ L2BB is focusing on sequencing 1 roll-up by Devcon, we are trying to figure out how to get there.
    ◦ _-> Paradigm wants to understand our current solution, they can help us navigate_
        ▪︎ OP mainnet technical upgrade process
        ▪︎ OPstack dynamics - what to target
        ▪︎ partnership with conduit
• *Uniswap x SUAVE*
    ◦ Paradigm suggests the best timing for Uniswap collab is next few months, focused on L2 sequencing design
    ◦ *Uniswap (L2)*
        ▪︎ considering not having a RFQ auction on L2
            • latest design: open orders (dutch auction) on L2
            • can SUAVE be the RFQ? can SUAVE collab with UniX on sequencing level?
        ▪︎ _-> synergistic with L2 BB priority, Uniswap is looking at existing L2 designs and exploring sequencing designs_
    ◦ *Uniswap (Ethereum mainnet)*
        ▪︎ what Uniswap wants: making on-chain liquidity competitive with off-chain liquidity. 
            • To allow on-chain liquidity to bid in UniX auction and get the guarantee that they can fill this on-chain at the time of the off-chain auction.
            • seems to need to integrate with the L1 builder.
        ▪︎ -> _synergistic with Pareto builder_
*Next steps:*
• L1 Pareto Builder team to decide whether and when to hold a jam session with Georgios on Pareto Builder, TEE-Boost etc. <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G3CSRBQR> 
• I will coordinate with <@U05BMHJMRNK> on a *L2 (OPStack) GTM virtual jam session*, inviting Georgios. cc. <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FP0H62HH> 
• I will coordinate a *Flashbots x Paradigm x Uniswap whiteboarding* during mid-May in NYC. <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FQH1553P> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03HT20PJES> <@U03GKHM4G9Z>

|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 07/05/2024 15:21:26 Z:
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> a thought is that we can go to SF to jam with Andrew and Georgios in person

|   IMO the TEE boost jam would be super helpful, probably more on the medium term horizon than something we do immediately.

What exactly was the idea around georgios <> pareto builder? Were certain open questions discussed or is this just an open invite

|   Pareto Builder jam - open invite, we didn't go into the specifics in our recurring syncs, intended to follow up in small groups should there be a need. 

TEE Boost jam - what do you think would be the right timing? this month or June or later?

I suggest to make the next recurring paradigm / flashbots sync (next Tuesday) to focused on L2 BB product strategy + GTM, and lemme know who from our side should join. 
We can jam internally first this week, market research x L2BB, as planned to get on the same page, and identify area of uncertainty we want GK to provide jnput. Let me know if this works for you!

Was away from my computer for awhile yesterday so I figured I’d go digging in the alpha mines :pick::
• *Alex from Fastlane:*
    ◦ Excited because they think they’re the “only intent project close to shipping (we’re in last week of audit)” and everyone else seems to be running into roadblocks
    ◦ Thinks SUAVE should be a wallet
    ◦ Most of their initial demand is “backrun OFAs on L2's and our anti-LVR hook stuff” and in terms of users deploying with them post audit they “have a few lined up”
    ◦ They consider a main use case of their product is to “sequence rollups”, no concrete details were able to be teased out
    ◦ Bearish 3074 because of the “invoker ecosystem” that it requires

    ◦ Arbitrum is "Pure latency race and the meta is fast networking, especially in and out of the sequencer. kinda like a cefi exchange"
    ◦ Op Stack Chains are "all the same and they are blind batch auctions so its like mainnet but much easier to reason about because it doesnt have all the bullshit in the middle"
    ◦ Level of competition on both chains is "decent", not enough size for an SCP to come in an takeover yet.
    ◦ 500ms - 1s blind auction is "as good as you can do" and the "design we like the most" because theres no deadweight loss from latency races
    ◦ would be nice to save money on reverts but it makes spam prevention harder
    ◦ would advise "L2 teams against getting too cute" bc the current OP designs work well for searching, they just want faster blocks on OP Chains

base readout:
• top line takeaway: Jesse is interested in suave building blocks for Base, they are super early in the journey though and we likely need to build a few key features to land them
• key considerations for them:
    ◦ neutrality: they have invested a lot in this, creating principles to guide their actions and sharing them with regulators - which do touch on tx ordering, we should dig those up
        ▪︎ Jesse expressed a concern about “giving it all to one party” in the form of Flashbots or even Base. I did pitch him on permissionless building on suave and he was excited by that. 
    ◦ op-stack alignment, asking if we were working with them, what we thought about interop
    ◦ mev revenue and helping to scale by reducing bot spam seemed to be the primary thing that caught his interest
• The coprocessor did not seem to pique his interest much at all, I pitched it twice and he wanted async materials. It’s possible that I just didn’t land it in the right way, though. I don’t think we have a clean and eye grabbing one liner for this right now.
• He is, interestingly, seemingly ok with a public mempool. The primary thing he seemed to care about is “neutrality” above all - even suggesting to maybe open the public mempool and just let builders compete like they do on eth l1. He was fine with sandwiching.
• He had no strong opinions on any of this though. I pitched him on the public mempool going away and that landed. Similarly, I pitched “permissionless building but in TEEs so we can constrain builders” and that seemed to land as well. My guess is we would need to offer this to get an integration - I don’t think they’ll “king make” a single builder, which makes sense.
• Jesse at some point appreciated our fair market principles which resonated because they have their own for Base.
• His team is actively trying to figure out interop specs but doesn’t really have any opinions
• He was keenly interested in mempool leaks and how to prevent them. He suggested to me that they pay us to monitor their mempool, and my initial thought was this probably didn’t make sense as a product for us but it actually might as a growth hack to get on the radar of these chains and to build relationships with key stakeholders.
    ◦ The pitch of “we would be economically incentivized to tend to and fix your mempool if you worked with us” resonated with him
• Finally, he asked about the relationship of our work to arbitrums thing, as well as that of espresso.

|   • definitely a large data point that the co-processor part doesn't sell well to L2s. This feels like a nail in the coffin for me on this pitch tbh. I think the only way to sell this component is by saying "co-processor brings X developers from the Y community" i.e. 10 from the AI community.
• similar to our "what does building at 1 gigagas per second look like" jam we probably need a "what does maximally neutral SUAVE look like" jam
• Another data point of an L2 not knowing what they want for PBS and thinking "we should default to what they do on L1"
• Focus'ing on the mempool as a growth hack I really like!

> *Potential roadblock in overpaying CEX orderflow:*
> We use a static policy and pay 2gwei priority as most CEX(eg. binance, kraken, okx, <http://gate.io|gate.io>) do, to avoid user’s bad withdrawal experience under extreme chain congestion conditions.
*OPPORTUNITY IN DISGUISE*
The suboptimal priority fee policy appears to be a stale and suboptimal CEX INDUSTRY STANDARD they can't explain!!! (I will validate this a bit further with OKX and Huobi folks).

What may move the needle in selling points IMO:
• Project how much they can make by saving on priority fees (esp in bull market)
• Clarify how easy the integration can be
• Clarify the low-risk for integration - emphasize the fall back to status quo
• Demonstrate ability to perform during market stress.
Bybit tend to pride themselves for being the _innovator_ in exchanges, we can leverage the war of attrition across Asian CEXes to tip the game and get them all. They may not be first real mover though but enough of a threat to others. Just like the mining pool devops engineer scene, Asia exchange wallet PM scene is small. <@U03H6U5F200> wdyt, flashback to MEV-geth days?

It would need to have at least a few other top dog CEX buy-ins though. For that we can also get our existing partner OKX interest as well. even if just for the signaling. <@U06TUB9EW2Y> Is OKX an overpayer? <@U05DY4WTLUB> are we in touch with OKX exchange wallet side?

*IF THIS POLICY STANDARD TURN OUT TO BE A BLOCKER FOR CEX*
CEX operate to make big money, and for things that requires a lot of work explaining to users, esp. if observability is an issue, they likely will not change. Don't forget we can still pitch Pareto Builder in other ways the CEX CEOs understand, e.g. dark pool.

I talked with Femi from Phantom today about using Flashbots as their default RPC. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Shea-Femi-Phantom-Flashbots-94938a25cf6a4608b1c6c6b5c911aefd>

We met a year ago during the early discussions about MEV-Share and DOWG. Since then MEV-Share has delivered $1m refunds, the market has started adopting MEV protection en masse (Metamask most recently), and we have identified a new opportunity for the pareto builder. I reached out to catch up on how these things could relate to phantom and see if they’d want to use the protect RPC by default.

Highlights
• Most of Phantom’s flow and attention is on solana. It’s ~80% of their focus, which means that anything they adopt on ethereum needs to be very little effort for them. Femi liked the fact that wallets could just send us transactions as usual without doing any extra work to get refunds.
• They don’t care that much about protection but are interested in monetization. We looked at the data on both MEV-Share refunds and the estimated opportunity for priority fee refunds (ie. pareto builder). Femi was interested in our analysis <https://dune.com/queries/3588844/6044208|here> which shows (very naive) projected overpayment.
• Femi had a bunch of questions about protect uptime, identifying flow, how multiplexing works, and getting more data. We ended up talking for twice as long as expected.
• As a next step they will figure out if there are any blockers to adopt protect by default (eg. UX/status tracking) and evaluate if the cost/benefit is worth it based on the data we shared. IMO they will adopt if it is extremely easy.

<@U02CJ9QVAL9> and I talked with Eyal from Bloxroute about partnering on the pareto builder. We suggested two paths to collaborate with them — as an orderflow provider monetizing their flow through refunds or an infrastructure provider running TEE nodes. We learned about Bloxroute’s current activities and fleshed out a possible (if tenuous) path forward.

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Bloxroute-Pareto-builder-d054f30a4f7b41f18a794a0e2e5a847c>

Highlights
• Bloxroute sells their exclusive orderflow to builders and uses their visibility at their relay to multiplex flow to the winning one. They’re looking directly at the block contents.
• Eyal pitched us on a bunch of features they offer. Geodistributed relays, grpc submission, low latency connections via private links between US <> EU, “validator gateway” which is basically a MEV-Boost relay colocated with the validator that lets the builder bypass relay latency in optimistic mode. 8/10 top builders use their highest tier of features which is something like $20k/month.
• They’re very financially oriented as expected. He wanted to talk already about terms for profit splitting on the builder, tried to upsell us, etc. He also had a bunch of complaints about the relationship with flashbots in the past.
• As far as how to move ahead they care less about monetizing their orderflow because they’re already doing this, mostly with titan.
• They are interested to run a benchmarking experiment where they send their flow to an instance of our builder and see how much more performant it is than the bloxroute one. They did the same thing with titan over 2 months and weren’t impressed.
• He hinted at a new product they’re working on to “give proposers more monopoly power”. He expressed that he’s frustrated with all these services that are redirecting MEV value from proposers back to users and orderflow providers.

Chatted with Medha from Uniswap today about integrating Protect. She’s the PM on their wallet team. She started off the meeting saying that they want to stop using MEVBlocker :smile: And it seems like we have a good chance to work with them on switching to Protect.

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Medha-Uniswap-Wallet-Protect-Chat-f6158ef2d37945dd894469229e1e3c00>

• They care about privacy and security guarantees for their RPC.
• To switch the RPC she needs to convince internal stakeholders that (1) it will be very simple from an engineering standpoint and (2) they should use Protect as a single RPC rather than adopting many. I expect (1) to be easy. We talked about (2) at some length and it seems that she is convinced but others internally might not be.
• She asked questions about how to understand the RPC market, what our focus is internally, what we are doing on L2s, and what other bespoke features wallets have asked us for in the past
• The wallet team’s p0 priorities in Q2 are bridging in the wallet, embedded wallets, and better onboarding UX. She’s excited for xchain swaps.
• As next steps we’ll provide docs on Protect + supporting thoughts on why it makes sense to use a single RPC instead of many. She’s going to put together an internal doc for uniswap and attempt to reach a decision in the next 2 weeks.

*Notes from meeting with Mark Tyneway (core dev, OP Labs)
Overall, my takeaway is our general focus on OPstack (not OP mainnet) is correct. The concreate thing we need to do is shipping builder-api, and strategize how to signal others within OPstack via builder-api upstream event to go one step further with us - sequence their chain. I wil figure out in this week, the most effective signaling: data vs. p*bs funding round vs. suapps. 
• Technical upgrade process in OP
    ◦ 3 hard forks per year for consensus level protocol changes, they have done 5 since Bedrock went live
        ▪︎ anyone can propose changes and get approved by governance, BASE team, a korean team all have successfully gotten their proposals approved
    ◦ For Builder-API incorporated into OP stack it does not require any hard fork or going through governance. 
• What OP Labs can do for us in the near term (with certainty)
    ◦ They want OPstack to have PBS
        ▪︎ Builder-api spec <@U05BMHJMRNK> wrote was super good and helpful
    ◦ They are not gonna do anything on OP main net anytime soon with builders
    ◦ They will upstream builder-api spec, he understands this can help us signal other chains within OPstack
    ◦ They are unopinionated about market structure, how we want to message this part is up to us
• OP Labs Timeline
    ◦ OP Labs near term priority is the getting permissionless fault proof live, currently in audit stage
        ▪︎ hard fork scheduled for 1st week of June
        ▪︎ recent drama with Arbitum
        ▪︎ NOTE: this is irrelevant to our collab -> builder-api doesn't need a hard fork to be upstreamed!
    ◦ Our core dependency is the codebase refactor that Protolambda is working on
        ▪︎ Mark estimates if Proto doesn't get distracted, it could be done in 2 weeks. 
        ▪︎ Once the refactor is done, the next step is to incorporate our builder-API code into OPstack codebase. 
        ▪︎ flashbots creating a PR would be the fastest path
    ◦ OP Interop spec going live is slated for Q4, more likely 2025 Q1
        ▪︎ having an interop builder will be really powerful, and they trust us to be able to do it when time comes, but not a blocker
        ▪︎ doesn't look like having an interop spec or POC is a must have for builder-api upstream
• Clarification of OP shifting from public goods funding to common goods within its ecosystem
    ◦ the rebranding is not a big deal, more a tightening of focus than a pivot
    ◦ they hired a governance phd to focus on controled experiment that can make the most impact with the grants money
    ◦ it is possible OP can collaborate a round with PBS foundation on funding PBS R&D that benefit OP ecosystem (note this is something i will need to coordinate a bit more, but potentially good for signaling OP stack. 
_Note: I have an L2GTM jam with <@U05BMHJMRNK> on Monday, will follow up with additional questions we have, and will likely have follow up meetings with Mark in addition to meeting with Tess (product) and Lizzy (data) this week._

We spoke with Murray and Woody, two engineers in charge of the “wallet infra” team at Bybit today. Cc <@U06TUB9EW2Y> <@U03GRQX5HGR> please add your thoughts and anything I missed!

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Bybit-Gas-Fee-Refunds-23b81cf8700c4169b91b376e2238c679?pvs=4>

• Their wallet infra team supports the wallets used by the bybit exchange as well as a new custody solution. There is also a separate web3 wallet team.
• They are primarily concerned with performance (all txs land <30sec). They pass gas fees onto customers.
• They had questions about how multiplexing works, how we ensure fast inclusion, and how the RPC works (what are the fallbacks / uptime).
• They’ll need broader org buyin to use the RPC. But if the refunds work, they think this should be straightforward. They also seemed interested to test the RPC in advance to confirm it can handle their load.
• They’ll send us info on their request volume and also connect us with their web3 wallet team.
• Fun fact they use TEEs! In their exchange and custody products.

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 14/05/2024 15:39:52 Z:
|   One takeaway for me is that this somewhat affirms the importance of starting with wallets who have an immediate value prop to adopt with the RPC

I do think these other parties are good to speak with though, especially as we’ll need time to convince them the RPC is ready for production use. A doc on that from a more technical angle could be handy here, eg addressing questions like
• Uptime
• Fallback plan
• Requests we serve per sec/whatever
• Etc
Basically the goal would be to convince people we are running best in class production grade industry standard RPC they can rely on for fast reliable inclusion. <@U03G3CSRBQR> might be up your alley
|   Something like the case study <@U05DY4WTLUB> did on OKX performance / inclusion could also be relevant
|   
|   > tesa [U06TUB9EW2Y] @ 15/05/2024 05:55:14 Z:
|   From my notes:

• During stressful conditions, they keep the priority fee the same and set the max fee to a significantly higher amount.  Under extreme market conditions, they will pause or accept a greater delay.
• Their main internal kpi for ethereum wallet performance is when a user initiates a withdrawal request, their request is included in a block in 30-40 seconds.  This includes their internal latency for risk management.
• The wallet team has 2 main products - 1 for the exchange, 1 for a whale custody solution.
• Wallet teams are all centrally managed with about 30-40 people on wallet infra.  
• Web3 wallet is a separate team.

|   <@U03PZSSETQA> will try to churn out historical trend data. Right now it is only cross-section data.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 15/05/2024 14:33:40 Z:
|   <@U05DY4WTLUB> I am thinking that the user focused reporting you did for OKX may be exactly what we need to do as part of the testing phase for each of these users

Historical trends could surely be useful. Especially if we start to have records of similar use cases (“eg other top exchanges had these metrics). Even then, I still think they might want to see precisely the impact for _their_ transactions. And showing a tailored “just for you” dash is a really nice way to emphasize that we’re giving them VIP support

Tl;dr aggregate data useful; use case based analysis even better; but even then the real winner might be rerunning analysis for each new provider.

If we can standardize that process (we already have a replicable dashboard which is great) and have a runbook for what we ask them to do in testing I think we’ll be in a really good spot here
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 15/05/2024 14:36:04 Z:
|   oh for that reporting it is router address based and only need router addresses.

It would also be quite straightforward to do a similar one based on origin_id, as long as they are actually strictly enforcing it
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 15/05/2024 14:37:04 Z:
|   Yeah think we’ll need originId for exchanges / protocols, probably some wallets too.

They may also just prefer to send us a list of tx hashes
|   And fwiw the idea of doing aggregate reporting is also a good one. I do think we have some stuff already on the public dune dash for land time and such. Interested if you think something crucial is missing from that!
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 15/05/2024 14:45:35 Z:
|   The dune dashboard is pretty good as it could only use publicly published data, as some analysis like landing rate would require private_tx entry data we did not publish

We had a funny three-way call with Alchemy and Robinhood (wallet) today. Alchemy offers a paid wrapper around our private transaction API and Robinhood wants to use it save transaction costs for their users. We got brought in to answer questions about how the API works.

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Robinhood-Alchemy-Flashbots-API-call-43214d46444e4fc789e5b0c1663e6e43>

Highlights
• Alchemy apparently told Robinhood that there is an “updated” version of our private transaction API which would allow them to stop paying for failed transactions. This is not precisely true; the alchemy folks seemed a bit confused.
• Robinhood is interested in this feature because they want to reduce costs for their noncustodial wallet users. They don’t care much about privacy.
• We fielded a bunch of questions from robinhood about how the API works and what the different settings are. Ex: What is the tradeoff between privacy and refunds? What is the downside of sharing with many builders? Can we customize our refund %? How do we identify refund transactions?
• The next steps are for alchemy to update their integration to support all of our features (like custom refund %s). Once they ship this we should start receiving flow from robinhood! We also asked for a shared slack channel with robinhood.
• All in all a very positive meeting for us. It turned out to be a great setup to build credibility with robinhood. Aand alchemy also could be a good BD partner if they’re onboarding accounts like this to use our APIs — we should think about how to make that partnership more robust (and not undercut them for now).
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 15/05/2024 07:42:24 Z:
|   following the logic here, we should start thinking about what kind of deals become possible once we start paying providers for orderflow. e.g. Alchemy could receive a % profit share for every partner they bring to us? kinda like affiliate model
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 15/05/2024 14:28:53 Z:
|   I do think we should give more thought to how we could structure a collaboration with alchemy here. I’m not sure how a profit share would work w the existing revenue model they have (need more data)

I had a quick chat with Ben and Vanessa from coinbase about ways we can work together in 2024. We only had 30mins to cover a lot of content but I was able to get a sense for their priorities and share some of ours. We identified a few things they want to learn more about — specifically gas fee refunds and TEEs.

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Coinbase-Pareto-Builder-a421dd15e7b14f7da3430acd271d6292>

Highlights below. There’s also a more detailed summary in the doc.
• Ben and Vanessa are focused on the staking/validators side of things, but serve as advocates for flashbots and can help us get new products adopted by other internal coinbase teams.
• The top priorities they listed across the exchange and wallet right now are compliance, staking, chain abstraction, and supporting base.
• They didn’t initially mention monetization as a priority but became quite interested in the gas fee refunds product. Ben: “coinbase always wants to make or save money”. They asked to see more materials and data, and were interested in the size of the opportunity / how to integrate.
• An interesting discovery: Coinbase has an institutional grade custody product (prime). It’s highly regulated. Apparently they built a new wallet extension on top of it so clients could receive tokens they received eg from eigenlayer rewards which weren’t approved for the regulated product. The user profile is basically “institutional scale clients with degen like behaviors” — !!
• They also were interested in our work on rollups and TEEs.
• Next steps: I am going to send a 1 pager on gas fee refunds and some data / analyses for them to run. Vanessa is going to review those and sounds like she will be our main advocate for wallet/etc. Separately we should send ben some nerd snipe materials on TEEs (any recs?)

|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 14/05/2024 22:45:37 Z:

<@U03HT20PJES> and I chatted IRL with Zano (<https://twitter.com/segfaultdoctor|segfault doctor>) Jito CTO:
• Vibe of the convo was more introductory and chaotic brain dump of each others architectures 
• Their infra is legit, I knew this before, but became more convinced. They geo-distributed to 5 different major regions (US, Tokyo, Frankfurt, 2 more I forget), have a latency over consistency cross-region replication model, have sub 5ms VPC connections and even sub 1ms connections to some validators by encouraging colocation, and spend ~$400-500k per month in servers for their simulation clusters mainly
• They have two components, a relay, and a block engine. The relay is a modified mempool validators run which delays injecting txns from network into validator for 200ms. Completely asynchronously the block engine will produce "portion of block" from private bundles and stream it into the validator before the 200ms is over
• On average Jito is only producing the 10% of the block (aka top 10% of the txns in the block), which is 3x more profitable than regular mempool blocks
• They receive 5k bundles per second and ~70% are spam. They use various heuristics to not consider most of these but are researching how to have the heuristic cut off less of the inputs (bundles)
• They shut down their "mempool" because people were sandwiching but now people are probabilistically sandwiching
• Interesting Solana validator lore: some validators arent building blocks and arent even validating blocks they vote on to save costs!
• They think rivals are around the corner so are exploring have anyone become a builder where the revenue % goes to the token, not the c-corp known as Jito Labs
• They ran a sting operation to discover validators who are selling the ability to sandwich to a specific person (named Ari) that they're going to "put on blast" soon, because thats how Solana social slashing works.
• My impression is they're eng chads in a green field ecosystem with little mechanism design knowledge or even deep understanding of distributed protocols. I think we can deeply benefit from a collab here.
• I've started an external chat with them in slack, lmk if interested in joining.

|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 16/05/2024 20:16:38 Z:
|   Dan said almost all of it. I'll add that
• their staking and "block building" businesses are completely separate, except that their staking pool nodes must connect to their block engine. 
• Their block engine is closed source
|   
|   > Leonardo Arias [U03G97GK4JZ] @ 16/05/2024 20:36:32 Z:
|   I'm interested in the social slashing. Can you please let me know what happens to Ari once the drama unfolds?
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 16/05/2024 20:39:27 Z:
|   I think people stop delegating to those validators and then also maybe Anatoly tweets some stuff for RPCs to not send txns to that validator
|   
|   > tesa [U06TUB9EW2Y] @ 17/05/2024 01:32:22 Z:
|   Interested as well.  Any more info on their probabilistic sandwiching?  Sounds similar to L2 mev strategies.
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 17/05/2024 01:39:40 Z:
|   No more but they have a nice explorer so we could do the analysis! <https://explorer.jito.wtf/bundle-explorer|https://explorer.jito.wtf/bundle-explorer> we have this same problem fyi <@U06TUB9EW2Y> and I am of the hypothesis this problem is fundemental to the question of whether we can actually make sequencers significantly more revenue with a new bundle auction design for L2s.

Chatted w/ Alex Gluchowski, co-founder of zksync
• zksync is in process of decentralizing w/ token + airdrop + governance-upgradeable + treasury/foundation. all pretty standard, except for one nice innovation: they are making a “council of guardians of the mission” that oversees critical decisions + partake in ermergency updates + can veto. (this is on top of a security council)
• their current sequencer runs on FCFS. they have a research team looking into MEV but it hasnt been a priority. long-term, they want to adopt long-term best practices (”whatever flashbots come up w”). also want to explore encrypted mempools, sandwiching very harmful, and no censorship
• they are working on decentralizing their sequencer through L2 consensus (similar to starknet, different from optimism/arbitrum). valdiators will start as operated by matter labs → then PoG → then permissionless
• their chain vision is solana-like throughput w/ hotstuff and parallel execution, while at the same time “be as decentralized as ethereum”. I got the vibes when the two conflict they will choose decentralization over performance. they are building a network of rollups where every chain will be a volition (aka choose your own DA on a per txn-basis)
• they are big fans of using TEEs for MEV mitigation, and in fact have a TEE team inhouse working toward security-in-depth (most likely for proving I assume). also gave us “big props for running tdx builder on mainnet”
• I’m facilitating an intro to their TEE team

Had a brief chat with Kevin from SCP at the office on friday. Will let robert chime in too but here are a few takeaways from me

Bloxroute is offering two features that give builders a big advantage at their relay.
1. They will tell you exactly when they are submitting the block to the proposer. As a result, you don’t have to share your strategic bid till the last second, giving you a chance to make more profit.
2. They also allow builders to set a “reserve price” bid that the relay will use if the strategic bid is too low. This essentially creates a private fallback price nobody else sees and gives these builders a second shot at winning the auction (just with less profit).
Also Titan continues to be up to hijinks with private backruns and isn’t transparent about it. This secrecy seems to have caused their collab with SCP to implode and the backruns are creating a bunch of problems for MEVBlocker.

<@U05BMHJMRNK> and I had a jam with some celestia peeps: Hlib (eng) and Gabriel (researcher)

We spoke mostly about censorship resistance and scaling execution through block building.

• they are working on a multi-proposer construction for tendermint. Its not high prio and not receiving many resources, but
    ◦ main motivations are throughput (since leader is their bottleneck) and censorship resistance
    ◦ their approach is similar to multiplicity but they don't want to use vote extensions. (I actually think their solution is theoretically stronger than multiplicity, but we didn't have time to get into the full details)
• They think that tendermint both sucks and is the best option available right now

Rabby Wallet (Debank) - <@U05DY4WTLUB> and I had a call with Eleanor (Yulei) Li

*tldr;*
• Rabby Wallet is a subsidiary of Debank based in Singapore. The team is small, 10-12 developers, and they are mainly focused on security and UX. Debank devs handle the chain integrations which is why Rabby Wallet has over 100+ chain integrations.
• Key custody is not available on the mobile and desktop app but it is available on the extension. Because they are primarily concerned about security, they did not want to enable key custody until they are 100% confident about security.
• Rabbyʻs does not charge a fee and is focusing on user acquisition. They believe they are number 2 for number of Ethereum transactions behind Metamask.
• Rabby uses a top-of-next-block simulation for user transactions to provide an estimate.
*Ethereum Questions:*
• Because they have a small team, Rabby Wallet are more selective about what to implement on new Ethereum tech (i.e. intents, account abstraction) and will explore the new tech once it has more conviction of its value.
• <@U03PZSSETQA> They currently use both Protect and MEV-Blocker on swap transactions. They estimate 300-400 Protect transactions daily.
• 100% of MEV refunds are being passed onto their users. They are not taking any revenue cut yet but are interested in learning about additional revenue drivers. Eleanor asked what other wallets were doing with refunds (answer: itʻs all over the place).
*Macro Questions:*
• Rabby and Debank are not too concerned about regulations.
• They do not chase trends - hottest chains, meme coins, etc. Their primary goal is to provide the best user experience possible with a focus on Ethereum and EVM chains.
Follow-up:
• <@U05DY4WTLUB> will ask their devs additional tech questions and help them integrate an originId into their current RPC set-up so that we can track their Protect flow.

Did they have any data to back this up? Significant if true!!
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 22/05/2024 21:25:12 Z:
|   Also interesting that they use both MEVBlocker and Protect. Did they say why? This isn’t generally recommended because it compromises the privacy model of both OFAs.

In case useful I recently wrote up some more detailed thoughts on this question for uniswap. Gives some specific reasons why a wallet should just use Protect. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Thoughts-on-the-RPC-market-e2cecaa6f4c04e0c8847940586128e15?pvs=4|https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Thoughts-on-the-RPC-market-e2cecaa6f4c04e0c8847940586128e15?pvs=4>

|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 23/05/2024 08:37:27 Z:
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> I assumed that they used logics like “we know how much tx we process (x%). we know how much Metamask claims to process (y%). if they add it up and  100 - (x+y) < x, then they can be confident that they are No.2 without knowing exactly the full picture
|   will ask them again about data sources on wallet activity level
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> I just checked and they did not know about the new fast mode. So performance probably has been horrible for them for a long time and it is not surprising that they multiplex to MEV-Blocker

I spoke with Andrea and Alex from MEVBlocker today to catch up on how their new rules are going and figure out if there is a path for us to collaborate in the future. We identified several potential ways that our work on TEEs could address their pain points and agreed to continue checking in as our work progresses. Overall the vibes continue to be positive here. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/MEVBlocker-Pareto-builder-commitment-service-e1587792655342afb7846db4305510f3>

How things are going
• Biggest pain point: How to *detect* misbehavior.
• Current solution: They use beaver as a reference for how MEVBlocker bundles should be processed. The SCP team is largely responsible for the operational work of flagging issues.
• Issues: They think SCP is incentivized to behave because they have a revenue share with MEVBlocker. But there isn’t an obvious solution if this fails or beaver has a bug. They’ve had a few issues with titan prioritizing non-OFA backruns but titan claims these are due to latency and MEVBlocker just has to give them the benefit of the doubt.
What they are focused on next
• What: Their main goal is to automate detection and enforcement of misbehavior. They plan to do this via “statistical analysis” at the agnostic relay. At runtime, the relay would compare the backrun that a user receives across all submitted blocks and raise an alert if one builder deviates substantially. This is similar to our idea of a “post-processing” service.
• Requirements: They need to compare against and store sensitive un-landed bid data if an alert is raised.
• Unsolved problems: This requires trusting the relay (they want stronger privacy guarantees for DA because they will have to store data on unlanded bids) and would force builders to submit to agnostic (which is unpopular).
How we can work together
• Remove the requirement to trust or submit to agnostic relay. We talked about using SUAVE/TEEs for DA, or running relays in TEEs in the limit. They don’t have a good solution internally so if we find one, I think they’d adopt it.
• Create a neutral benchmark to compare builders against (instead of SCP). Possible solutions: run a neutral TEE builder and use it to detect the baseline cases of misbehavior. This won’t catch everything but Andrea liked the idea of an incremental improvement.
• Give better privacy guarantees in a subset of blocks. They have had several instances of builders leaking private orderflow. Once we have a TEE builder with decent market share, they could submit directly to it and not share with other builders. This prevents privacy leaks in the % of blocks that the TEE builder wins; Andrea was interested in that and we agreed to follow up when our TEE builder / multiplexing / market share is ready for this.
• Explore new bundle types. A future goal for their simulation work will be to value bundles based on swap execution, not just refund value. This sounds like similar designs we’ve been exploring for UniX, propeller heads.

|   Do they have data on the “blind frontrunning on large swap” we feared before? Have we ever asked them about it and what they think of it?

:mega: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Propeller-Heads-0ea2fa8538204da2ab43ae57b8a80c11|PropellerHeads NYC Jam Readout>:
• The meeting aimed to align the roadmap for product and marketing, particularly focusing on EthCC, Testnet, and the three product versions, while determining the timeline for these developments.
• Key Topics and Decisions
    ◦ *Solver and Exchange Products:*
        ▪︎ Teams are exploring new solver functionalities, including using solvers as oracles.
        ▪︎ Developing a long-tail instant indexing product and markout analysis service.
        ▪︎ Goal to reduce liquidity integration time from 2 weeks to under 1 day.
    ◦ *Dark Pool Solutions:*
        ▪︎ Focus on protecting user information for large transactions.
        ▪︎ Addressing LVR for LPs next.
        ▪︎ Differentiating from Sorella by ensuring privacy in the dark pool design.
        ▪︎ Simplified user interface to meet fund needs, providing market orders and informed pricing.
    ◦ *SUAVE Dependencies:*
        ▪︎ Emphasizing full privacy and control over order information.
        ▪︎ Midpoint derivation on TEEs and private route submission.
        ▪︎ Basic version doesn't require distribution, but redundancy is a concern.
    ◦ *Product Development and Funding:*
        ▪︎ Current development includes midpoint derivation, order saving, and batching.
        ▪︎ Working on route submission with a focus on latency.
        ▪︎ Sufficient runway, considering dark pool’s role in the fundraising narrative.
        ▪︎ Aiming for product readiness by EthCC.
• Future Items but Not Necessarily Immediately Actionable
    ◦ *L1 and Builder Incentives:*
        ▪︎ Offering relative bribes to builders and seeking competitive builders to implement logic more strictly.
        ▪︎ Ensuring solvers have near-perfect block inclusion predictability due to Dutch auction OFAs.
        ▪︎ Interested in gas refunds and efficient bundle types for solvers.
    ◦ *EthCC Preparation:*
        ▪︎ TEE Builder PoC expected to be ready.
        ▪︎ Concerns about timeline slippage and leaking competitive edge.
        ▪︎ Collab on a Dark Pool day?

i'm catching up with my old friend dan finlay from metamask tomorrow, let me know if you have any questions i can pass on :slightly_smiling_face:

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 23/05/2024 19:29:27 Z:
|   I would love to learn how he feels about the SMG in house collaboration this far, and what his view on the metamask smart tx impact on the market structure!

|   Dan manages core wallet projects, and is only high level aware of the ofa project. 

I brought him up to speed on MEV, decentralization and privacy, the OFA, from first principles. 

I emphasized the importance of data and transparency for both community outsourcing of important internal metrics and ecosystem health. 

I requested that at the minimum they publish transaction hashes processed by their OFA. This is all we need to get a sense of participants, order flow size, and other things we care about. 

He took this request seriously. 

> Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 28/05/2024 20:42:22 Z:
PSA we have a new channel with the robinhood team and alchemy. The immediate goal of the channel is to have a venue to discuss robinhood’s integration of the private transaction API. In the future, it may also be a good touchpoint for further discussions with their team. Just note that alchemy will also be in the channel, so let’s ensure our comms don’t seem to cut them out.

If you think you’re relevant to that conversation let me know and I’m happy to add you <#C0765M5HPPA|>

Heads up: I Emailed zksync's CTO + head of research on two matters
1. connect our respective TEE teams
2. understand where they are re L2 sequencer decentralization, and how we can help them

Had a great chat with Austin Adams:
• Austin's last day at Uniswap Labs is June 3rd but is still staying on as an Advisor
• Said he was responsible for Uniswap's shift to L2 strategy because he believes it's not possible to build a profitable DEX on L1 anymore
    ◦ He wrote up his findings in this paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09494>
• What he wants to cook on now: a Unchain Sequencer on SUAVE.
    ◦  His first proposed design includes 
        ▪︎ a top of block FCFS with preconfs for LPs
        ▪︎ normal flow in the middle,
        ▪︎ and a bottom of block arb bot called ArbDAO. 
    ◦ Also wants a BeforeBlock and AfterBlock hooks that the above points could utilize and to also increase the effectiveness of V4 hooks on unichain
• Said m<https://x.com/DistributedMarz/status/1783988767050629320|y tweet on how Base is starting to look like Solana> "changed his world view" and he wants to help L2s avoid a solana-like fate.
• He also said he helped Eric Zhong with the UniX SUAPP and that was the moment where he realized he needed to quit because "labs is boring and theres so much more fun stuff like SUAVE"
• When asked what was interesting about SUAVE : "we have thrown out hundreds of L1 mechanisms because of adversarial block building on L1 but that's not a problem on L2s!"
• Thinks "L2 MEV/Appchain Summer" is here and he wants to position himself to do interesting DEX/PBS/MEV related research to help steer these directions.
Decisions & Next Steps:
• Austin would like a grant to formally cook with us 
• We want to set up some time to recurring jam after he leaves Uniswap Labs
• Said he is thinking of moving to New York if his grant plans work out
Overall I am pretty excited by the idea of collaborating with Austin because I think he could fill a large gap in competency around AMM design that we do not have! Also his advisor role means we would still keep him as an internal champion at Uniswap labs.

Notes from chat with Espresso Ben last week (these are more raw sorry!) :
• They're interested in supporting a preconf mevboost
• Tim Roughgarden told them their "combinatorial lottery" is too complicated
• Mentioned the working theory that a lottery is an interpolation of an auction and random leader election with the former favoring efficiency and the latter favoring diversity
• Their "marketplace" where rollups can sell proposal rights is later in Q3
    ◦ For this they need block builders watching this layer and building blocks
• Launching their "non-testnet" net (but not mainnet bc no token) in June
• Want to collaborate on a PoC to
    ◦ demonstrate multichain interop through espresso
    ◦ fine to start with OP Stack
    ◦ would prefer arbistrack since they will go live with Arbistrack chains first in Q3ish
    ◦ They also like arbistack better bc of the fraud proofs
• Willing to add SGX attestations to espresso auction as an option but not v0, likely v1
• revealed some alpha that Arbitrum nitro/orbit chains are controlled by the DAO which is much easier to influence/less opinionated against flashbots than Arbitrum Labs
• <@U03GRQX5HGR> came in last second and hard balled them. At this point Ben revealed that there is potential token incentives to being the first builder on their chain and that they could slow down convos with others like Titan for us if we were ready to commit. Also interested in a cross-org token swap

Enclave.market notes from last week (also raw since it's been a bit sorry!):
• Have been operating a TEE and blockcbased dark pool for over a year!
• 10% of their flow is retail coming from AVA, the rest is from a professional firm Hidden Road
• Discussed an idea for <http://TEEBeat.com|TEEBeat.com> which would define standards for CEXs similar to L2Beat. Example being step 0 is Proof of Reserves, then step 1 is TEE based wallet keys.
• They are running in TEEs but not really in a secure way. 
    ◦ Logs are being leaked
    ◦ No "real attestation"
    ◦ They have "attestors" but mentioned something about them reviewing lines of code... unclear if that is a physical human approving upgrades or what...
    ◦ Attesters bring in the Eth state to the enclave
• Have an eng team working out of Ava labs office in WB that can come to Duck and jam sometime
    ◦ their biggest bottleneck was surprise surprise.... state root calculation!
• Trad MM don't like the TEEs and almost refuse to integrate/dont have a big enough carrot atm
• They do 1000s of txns per second
• CISO's love the TEE value prop, most other people prefer the market structure aspect of funds being non-custodial via blockchain and key in TEE
• They're launching a Perp market soon which is a LIT orderbook (idk what LIT means yet but I hear it a lot lol)
• Reg wise:
    ◦ They KYC
    ◦ Have a Cayman License that they view as a strategic asset
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 30/05/2024 00:35:12 Z:
|   lit exchange is a non-dark pool, where you can see the orderbook. the perp market they are only using tee for policy enforcement - proof they are not tampering with the orderbook, something they mentioned tradfi ciso cared
|   their biggest bottleneck is their cap table dominated by Ava labs - which is why i am trying to help them merge with Propellorhead... a merger will help them restructure cap table, which can help them raise capital.
thus far enclave.market chatted with propellorhead, and they figured out a product level collab as of last saturday - on-chain and off-chain integrated liquidity solution - you can prolly ask them for details.
|   
|   > tesa [U06TUB9EW2Y] @ 30/05/2024 07:06:12 Z:
|   Lit exchanges are different than lit order types. Lit (limit if touched) order types are hidden unless the price trades near or through it then the order appears as a limit order. 

For example, the market is 100 bid 110 offered and someone has a lit sell at 120. The sell order only appears if the market trades at 120.  A lit sell order can not be placed below the current best offer - only > 110 in the above example.
|   You can have a lit market with lit orders and those lit orders will be hidden until they are triggered.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 30/05/2024 20:50:11 Z:
|   by lit orderbook tho i thought they meant lit exchange instead of lit order type?

Spoke to Libevm & Minimoon today:
1. orderflow and builder collab
• Libevm's CEX-DEX searcher will be spun up by the end of June, they are working with a top searcher and expecting their set up to be more efficient than most others. 
• I mentioned we are considering bootstrapping an open source rust builder that's credibly neutral - they expressed interest to help us bootstrap with their flow because they know we are credibly neutral, as long as we don't have unbundling attacks or other risks. <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> 
• They mention for most searchers even if there's a good neutral builder who may still prefer to also run a builder, citing bottom of block backrun as an example integration needs ;) There's a world where a neutral builder is so good they can see themselves shutting down their own. <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> 
• Side note: Penguin builders codebase is primarily geth, data extraction is rust based. They tried to write a rust builder bu the state root calc is too slow so they scratched it.
• they are open to contributing to our open source builder codebase for a grant in the future. <@U03G3CSRBQR> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> 
• side note: I asked if Penguin is bidding in Metamask smart tx auction yet, they said the system is such that discriminate small builders so they have to wait for their CEX DEX flow before joining the metamask bidding.
2. investment
• they are raising for the first time, 3m at 30m post, currently Mirana committed 50% (Bybit investment arm), talking to Fastlane and Jito and Flashbots. 
• they have 1 BVI Holding entity, 1 BVI trading entity, 1 australi based analytics entity
• raising for CEX-DEX (main biz), Penguin builder, Libmev dashboard.
• They expect their CEX-DEX searching coming online will trigger the current market to be more competitive (forcing everyone to JITing onchain exec). They pride themselves on good risk management, Minimoon was a senior trader in a HFT, only risk of exchange rugpull or malfunctions. They are expecting to be able to get VIP tier price feed with Bybit collab.
• consequences of building CEX Dex they plan to build a swap aggregator - more gas efficient and better onchain routing than existing players, may have a token in the future, may getting listed in bybit wallet. working with top searchers. only onchain sources.
• Via Bybit/Mantle investment, they mentioned Mantle is interested in asking the mto help extract MEV for their sequencer ops in the future. <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> 
• 1m will be parked in Binance for their cex-dex, others on human capital and opex.
3. State of MEV data grant (w/UF+PBSF) <@U06TUB9EW2Y> <@U05578MHMUZ> <@U03N9H4JP8C> 
• definitely interested in a data grant, I mentioned 20k-50k range
• qa for Brontes L2 data, cross compare with their own
• spin up L2 nodes and provide L2 data for researchers
• spin up L2 MEV analytics dashboard and work on taxonomy
• open sourcing Libmev MEV indexers in the future

• Left Eigen Layer
• Now working with James (Prestwich) and Anna on a Rollup 
• Details were not super clear bc short call but roughly:
    ◦ trading fees subsidized by MEV
    ◦ builders are also validators (idk what this means)
    ◦ they plan to profit off of base fee
    ◦ want to onboard block builders and asked for help in doing that
• They would be interested in being "a customer of SUAVE"

Call with OP Labs Mark Tyneway + <@U05BMHJMRNK> TODAY, Notes: <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/L2-GTM-6-Month-Game-Plan-WIP-1991b24519cc404bb788a16ca3039f62?pvs=4#85992159f6c64cf28d4322682cf91312|L2 GTM 6-Month Game Plan (WIP)>

*My key takeaways (<@U05BMHJMRNK> please add yours in thread!)*
• SUAVE / OP collab dependencies
    ◦ Protolambda is still working on the refactoring that `builder-api` being merged is dependent upon
    ◦ OP devnet is a dependency for our builder (no one in OP owns the devnet, they appreciate help)
    ◦ *Mark is happy to spend 30min to unblock our team on the devnet fix ASAP*
        ▪︎ → call with Jinsuk scheduled for Friday <@U05D21T09GX> 
• OP interop testnet targeting October
    ◦ *OP Labs need to run its own sequencer during testnet*
• OP interop mainnet aiming for December
    ◦ *no plans for sequencers yet - blocked by legal risk analysis (Mark thinks Base may have same legal concerns) <@U02CJ9QVAL9>* *<@U03FP0H62HH>* 
• OP interop ecosystem players
    ◦ *Unichain: OP has a feature for protocol enforced sequencing rule, that can enforce priority fee (as well as PBS, etc.) in protocol <@U02CJ9QVAL9>* *<@U03PZSSETQA>* *<@U03FP0H62HH>* 
    ◦ *OP Interop is working with Wonderland on OP stage 2 interop - smart contracts, etc.*
        ▪︎ Note: Wonderland is a Flashbots fan, we almost collab on L2 MEV quantification
    ◦ *OP rejected Espresso deep integrations earlier on, that will impact how they ship their fraud proof etc. so OPstack rejected; Espresso instead turned to Arbitrum orbit immediately*
    ◦ OP dev shop Test in Prod is not working on OP interop
    ◦ Kurtosis had an early collab with OP but OP did not work with them, because they are extractive in their EF deal
• *Jun 13 NYC OP/FB hackathon: Mark invites Flashbots to hack w/ OP interop team*
    ◦ OP NYC retreat is Jun 10-14. Jun 13 is OP co-working day
    ◦ OP interop team will be hacking on Jun 13: Mark, Protolambda, Diego
    ◦ OP also invited Wonderland
• *Week of Jun 24 CA hacking: Mark will be in Edge City in June, follow up hacking session in week of Jun 24 in California would be a good timing.*
• July BR EthCC week: Mark may need to BD other OPStack chains to adopt interop, e.g. World Chain, Zora
    ◦ → opportunity for co-marketing <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FP0H62HH> 
    ◦ would be good to have a TDX interop builder live on OPdevnet
• Nov DevCon week: we jammed on an Interop Demo idea
    ◦ we gave Mark a sense of what we can do with our interop builder 
    ◦ → e.g. Twitter plays Uniswap, Twitter thread sent by sequencers, etc. <@U03G0PNEV0E>

Spoke to Michael Ourabah, ceo of BSO, and Steve Murray, co-founder Multipool Finance.  Meeting notes are <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/BSO-May-31-2024-60fe6ddb0b9a486eaa6c3d7714a7f0b2|here>.

BSO is a global low-latency network and cloud solutions provider.  They have a network of 240+ PoPs across 33 markets, 50+ cloud on-ramps, 75+ on-net internet exchanges, 30+ stock exchanges, and top crypto exchanges.

BSO wants to work with / hire Flashbots to create a low-latency Ethereum relay.  Michael understands this is not a money-making proposition but rather a play to leverage BSOʻs network. <@U03G3CSRBQR> <@U03GALFRWRG>

BSO advantages: <@U03GRQX5HGR>  <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U02CJ9QVAL9>
• they service nearly all major hft shops and financial institutions
• run the infrastructure for CME and Nasdaq
• have microwave, submarine, and low-latency land lines in their network
• private cloud infrastructure and data center access with every public cloud provider
• strong understanding of financial system architecture and networking
Multipool Finance is BSO backed and is an order book exchange on Ethereum mainnet targeting professional traders and RWAs.  Multipoolʻs key features low-latency networks, FIX apis, trustless RFQs, p2p repo lending, and mev protection.  Multipoolʻs deck is included in the notes.

Multipool wants to work with Flashbots on:
• Protect <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U05DY4WTLUB> 
• Running their RFQs in TDX <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
• Smart-multiplexing <@U03PZSSETQA> 
They would like intros to:
• strategic trading infrastructure KOLs 
• licensed crypto fintech on / off-ramps or wallets

|   > Mateusz Morusiewicz [U03GALFRWRG] @ 31/05/2024 13:33:12 Z:
|   Given our current focus and resource constraints I’d be bearish we can build a low latency relay for them
Might be there’s some alternative path, and that’s not to say we wouldn’t improve the current relay
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 31/05/2024 13:34:36 Z:
|   can they just use open sourced Titan relay
|   or the open-sourced version is not as good as the production one
|   
|   > tesa [U06TUB9EW2Y] @ 31/05/2024 13:54:33 Z:
|   They have their own dev team to build the relay. Flashbots would play more of a consulting type of role like determining optimal relay locations.  Do you think BSO could help FB relay with low latency networking?
|   They would be neutral so we could help set them up and they have the commercial resources to maintain and improve it if we can recommend features.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 31/05/2024 13:59:00 Z:
|   how would making a relay of their own "leverage BSO's network"?
|   
|   > tesa [U06TUB9EW2Y] @ 31/05/2024 14:00:48 Z:
|   They have data centres all over the world and partnerships with aws. You can colocate in the same data centre as an exchange or you can actually get in the rack next to their server.
|   Plus they have the ultra low latency connectivity with microwaves and submarine cables.
|   In hft you can try to save microseconds in algo optimization or update hardware / network capabilites and save milliseconds.
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 31/05/2024 14:03:23 Z:
|   <@U03FP0H62HH> it sounds like they are the chad TradFi HFT version of Bloxroute
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 31/05/2024 14:12:40 Z:
|   ah I see. I wonder if there is any collab potential, esp considering we are trying to obsolete relays entirely with tee-boost
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 31/05/2024 14:14:21 Z:
|   Even if there is tee-boost, the networking leg from builder to proposer can still be optimized. The BDN thing of Bloxroute does that.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 31/05/2024 14:16:00 Z:
|   absolutely yeah
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 31/05/2024 14:16:36 Z:
|   it'd be nice to have a networking counterweight to blxr

how do builders know they've won? they need to be told by a relay - relay is always going to be faster

having the most up to date view of the CL clients can be useful because you can stop your old building tasks and start new ones

|   A dump of thoughts
• On a high level the idea of having a more aligned party with similar competencies to bloxroute is very appealing
• Their interest in the relay as a service specifically may not be precisely what we want in the long term but there may very well be a medium term where even with TEE proofs in MEV-Boost we still need to run some pared-down service and being very good at that (and integrated/colocated with our building network) matters — maybe engaging with them on this “not end game but one step forward” architecture is interesting
• Wonder if they would run geodistributed network of TEE nodes
• Maybe we could also use this for uber performant bidding/responding to relay bids/multiplexing
• Curious what SCP’s relationship and assessment of them would be (impressed, want to collab, competitor, unimpressed)

• Second part of June sounds reasonable for spinning up Conduit <> SUAVE PoC
• Keeping PoC scoped to OP Stack is fine for now but ideally works with Arbistack in near future
• Conduit is roughly 50/50 Arbi vs OP but Arbistack seems to be growing in popularity
• Good callout that Superchain related Sequencer changes need to be gov approved
• An advanced PoC could be “Show SUAVE in the front end in “alpha” and let people play with it in a hackathon” but need SUAVE to be a bit more self serve to enable that so unlikely by EthCC
• Conduit preferred upgrade path for existing rollups:
    ◦ collaborate on co-marketing ahead of demand
    ◦ share with existing rollups
    ◦ then evaluate options based off of demand.
:sparkles:*Next Steps*:sparkles:
• Emiliano to get back to <@U05BMHJMRNK> on Conduit availability for PoC
• Flashbots to brainstorm on what ideal co-marketing shape looks like on our end

• Purpose of the meeting was to discuss Conduit helping us with our interop builder devnet (massive DevEx improvement for us as we will likely be living in this multi-rollup environment for the next while)
• Kurtosis already has a OP Stack package but its 7 months old
• Currently working on an OP-Reth kurtosis package
• Interop builder Kurtosis set up sounds like no problem
• They want to help us set up something modular that we can swap in arbistack for
• Don't really need a grant but would take one, my personal read is that they want to co-market "flashbots uses kurtosis". fine with me tbh.
• Tedi is willing to come for a few days to our NYC hackathon to help us with this set up
• We will be collaborating in this notion document <https://www.notion.so/tedi-mitiku/Flashbots-Interop-Builder-49b2c2cf62fe4c1fb8872405f71dbefc>

An interesting chat with yet another person <@U055KQHH3FZ> seems to have impressed in a debate about TEEs :sweat_smile:

I mostly wonder about what projects like cycles.money who are looking to do interesting things with MEV (or even MEV taxes a la DR) can achieve in an "open marketplace for mechanism" which was the part of the SUAVE pitch that nerdsniped me originally. Maybe there are more exotic redistribution strategies arising from this kind of work which could influence how we think about pareto?

In either case, I sense that it is good to have relationships with others actively working on TEEs, and cycles.money uses both TEEs and ZK, which Andrew tweeted about <https://x.com/socrates1024/status/1798767228894204120|here>.

• He uses fortanix and works closely with them. He also ran into a ton of fortanix specific problems 
• Instead of just TLS from enclaves, he also suggests using DNSSEC from enclaves too. That is a good idea
I got a little confused by some things he has in mind for applications that is like DevOps for DAO tooling where you prove you upgraded your UI or dev environment to latest using enclaves

|   From a platformist viewpoint, the best opportunity here is a collaboration between Flashbots and Cycles (Informal Systems) to make SUAVE have eth and cosmos.
But from a product perspective no one should want this, it's a rabbithole timesink without customers but ++coordination cost, resources are directed to focus on customer needs (builders and solvers for suave, Fintech accounts payable for Cycles)

Notes from my 1:1 with <https://x.com/DrewVdW|Drew Van Der Werff> (Commit-Boost coordinator), and Kubi (Titan).
_Context: I know Drew from before - we met him when he was still at Goldman running their crypto team, and he actually applied for Flashbots after deciding to leave Goldman. I had many chats with him about his career and despite we didn't end up working with them, we have stayed in touch throughout his years at Brevan Howard, and also when he first announced leaving BH and freelancing at Eigenlayer._
• Drew is a great facilitator coordinator talent (he has a lot of respect for Danny Ryan and aspire to be in this role for preconf space) - he fell down the commit boost rabbithole when doing due dilligence at BH on Eigenlayer, and wrote an initial Eigenlayer forum post. He left BH recently for a variety of reasons, but also wanting to exploring building a project for 2-3 year. He is super committed and motivated by the Ethereum vision, and thought the need of emerging competing standards across the preconf space, and and opportunity to collaborate.
• Sreeram gave him a large grant to explore openly, and Drew is deeply interested in the preconf space. However he does not have any developers nor is he a researcher, so he basically just reached out to people he know in the space that could have interest in helping. 
    ◦ btw this is super similar to early day flashbots, I literally went through the exact same thing, and I could tell in today's preconf call within 5min, thats the state he is in right now. catching up and hearing from his side connected a lot of dot for me.
• Drew believes if he can get support / traction in the next 6 month with commit-boost, he is down to devote 2-3 years of his life making it work, maintaining it like an ethereum client team would. 
• I asked him (apparently Stokes also asked him the same question) why not work at the EF - Drew mentioned that if EF is open to it he would gladly do it, or get a grant from the EF working on this.
• We spoke about practical next steps:
    ◦ I mentioned on the Preconf Call today that I believe the PBS foundation should support the effort of figuring out the positioning between MEV-boost and commit-boost (along with all the other forks), in grants funding - while I am not on the research review committee at PBSF I believe it fits the mandate of the PBSF. 
    ◦ Next week, Drew (with Justin) is going to coordinate all of the existing preconf projects to compare notes (all needs to have code shared is Justins ask) and try to see if there can be a standard emerging. I guess Drew is hoping that commit-boost can be the standard setter.
    ◦ We both think we should aim for getting clarity during Zuberlin the design/roadmap/engineering compatibility between the MEV-boost protocol and commit-boost (and ofc all of the others). Depends on this, how MEV-boost and future commit-boost effort can be governed.
        ▪︎ Both Drew and Kubi see commit-boost as a client implementation, and MEV-boost as a protocol - which I personally agree.
        ▪︎ Drew clarified that Titan does not have a stake in this, they contributed core devs because Drew does not have anyone, but so did a bunch of other teams (Justin also asked Nethermind if they can support this).
        ▪︎ Drew hopes that this effort can be credibly neutral, he is still learning from ground up about open source development, he hope by next week, they would have a repo.
            • he clearly have not thought much about how to handle the collaboration and the open sourcing, he thinks maybe it would first be under his personal repo.

Not clear on the details, but is that even possible as client-only change? Seems you'd need at least out-of-protocol validator modifications, or actual protocol changes, to make this work, no? cc/ <@U05BMHJMRNK> (i'm not up-to-date on the details, but this triggers my curiosity)
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 06/06/2024 20:08:56 Z:
|   Yes this is definitely all out of protocol changes. Maybe <@U03GRQX5HGR> and Drew mean the client teams would develop their own version?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 06/06/2024 20:13:30 Z:
|   figuring out the details is literally on the agenda I created for next week, and both drew and Kubi (independently in our 1:1s) said they want to get this level of clarity, across preconf forks and between MEV-boost and them, see <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C03FF02HPTN/p1717701810106459?thread_ts=1717592457.005469&cid=C03FF02HPTN|note here>.

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 08/06/2024 11:58:31 Z:
|   <@U03G4UY5NN9> I suggest you and me catch up and coordinate. I already spoke extensiely with Justin, Kubi, Drew, Sreeram (later today)  and MEV-boost coordinators Stokes, Terrence and keeping Flashbots MEV-Boost maintainers in the loop. I have also been in close touch with Barnebe and other researchers. I was on about 12+ hours of 1:1 calls with different parties trying to figure out whats going on, and somehow I may have now much more context than both Justin, Drew and Kubi, and have connected the dots...

I will be sharing a memo I wrote up, on how the ecosystem can work together and how PBS Foundation can play a role in this. There are a lot of confusions in the community and complete misunderstanding, and significant context missing.

My curation next week on Zuberlin will primarily focus on sense making and clearly identify a path forward for MEV-boost, and clarity

|   <@U03G4UY5NN9> Nethermind and Flashbots will definitely play a key role in this. There is too much context and misinformation, and thats why I wanted to write it down first - but all I can say is this can be turned into something great for us and the ecosystem!

|   What’s the scoop on why titan is helping with commit-boost? What are their incentives here?

Ex
• Legitimacy
• Help their relay business differentiate
• Advantage their builder
• What else
I don’t necessarily view them as malicious here but they definitely are rational. They wouldn’t be devoting resources if they didn’t get something out of it, and curious to hear from folks closer to the situation what exactly this gives them
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 09/06/2024 17:53:37 Z:
|   no incentives - drew and Kubi knew each other long before titan, helping out
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 09/06/2024 18:01:00 Z:
|   Kubi is contributing to a bunch of things, ofc many of them are trying to get in early and direct architecture of something potentially important but shared infra. 
Justin Drake (this is verified independently of other people unrelated to Justin) is not deeply involved - he learned about this in 2 weeks, and realized Drew is a bit green at open source Ethereum coordination but has potential, so suggested them to pitch to all parties. 
Sreeram gave Drew a small grant because of the Eigenlayer forum post he made with Kydo. I'm speaking to Sreeram in 2 min to understand more.
Everyone can have their "attempts" and "agenda" in contributing to ecosystem r&d... but ethereum is an open collaborative environment, and no one can get by with pushing their personal agenda if it's disgenuine without being called out (same with us).

wrt commit-boost - Stokes and I are keeping a close eye on it, and we are welcomed to collaborate. will diligence if it's a worthwhile effort this coming week - so far it's been a bit loose, but if drew is doing good work and a quick learner, I see it as a good partner to fold in.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 09/06/2024 19:10:41 Z:
|   Interesting so it’s somewhat of a personal tie for kubi. Broadly agree w these points, I still think it’s worth poking at why they devote engineering resources because could be some alpha for us there
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 09/06/2024 19:31:09 Z:
|   yeah I'm sure we can get access to their code - stokes took a look on Friday - basically just hacking it together cuz Justin requested all preconf projects to ideally bring and share code by Zuberlin, as a force functioning. 
looks like commit-boost and Chainbound are trying to open source by then, but it's really early

• His new R&D shop has three bets at the moment: Uniswap DAO, Flashbots, and whoever wins Unichain
• His ideal output for his R&D shop: "White papers are nice, but we want to say “this design is running in prod” and willing to provide code where necessary"
• Gave Uni's perspective on where compliance lies in the Unichain system and how they would prefer an external party to operate this
• His POV on SUAVE value prop:
    ◦ Outsourcing Compliance
    ◦ Programmable Block Building
    ◦ Logically Centralized Ordering Rules
• Discussed Tripartite Block Structure:
    ◦ FCFS is good for LPs or at least fast block times
    ◦ blind back running is hard to detect
    ◦ understudied how lowering fees affect DEXs
    ◦ optimize for LPs and retail flow
*Next Steps*
• Group Plan: Optimistic Plan to publish "design lite paper" + maybe PoC code for tripartite block structure by Eth CC
    ◦ we're still exploring if we like the design so its optimistic in the sense that we like it enough to ship it
    ◦ (additionally we're chatting w/ Dan R next week to discuss this more)
• <@U05BMHJMRNK>: scope out work for Preconfs
• Austin: Preliminary design doc by Next Weds
• <@U02CJ9QVAL9>: Handle conversation with Austin about grant feasibility and requirements (roughly: help us land Unichain)

<@U03G4UY5NN9> I suggest you and me catch up and coordinate. I already spoke extensiely with Justin, Kubi, Drew, Sreeram (later today)  and MEV-boost coordinators Stokes, Terrence and keeping Flashbots MEV-Boost maintainers in the loop. I have also been in close touch with Barnebe and other researchers. I was on about 12+ hours of 1:1 calls with different parties trying to figure out whats going on, and somehow I may have now much more context than both Justin, Drew and Kubi, and have connected the dots...

I will be sharing a memo I wrote up, on how the ecosystem can work together and how PBS Foundation can play a role in this. There are a lot of confusions in the community and complete misunderstanding, and significant context missing.

My curation next week on Zuberlin will primarily focus on sense making and clearly identify a path forward for MEV-boost, and clarity

• Eigenlayer is happy to follow Flashbots or PBS Foundation lead on MEV-boost/commit-boost; Eigen Foundation can donate through PBS Foundation,
• Bullish on TEEs. TEE projects building on Eigenlayer are all AVS's, primary use cases are for computational integrity to improve trust; the only privacy use case is key share. 
• Super bullish on TLS notary - Eigenlayer mission is to vampire attack web2 cloud for mass adoption, excited to invest resources to collab with on TEEs for TLS notary use case.
• Sreeram believes EigenDA can be a good fit for SUAVE bulletin chain, as by design EigenDA is good for censorship resistance for “big items” like blocks in SUAVE block building usecases. (Already in discusion with Quintus on CR designs)
_Sreeram may come to NYC to jam with us the following week on DA, TLS and TEEs! <@U05BMHJMRNK>_ _<@U03HT20PJES>_ _<@U03GKHM4G9Z>_ _<@U055KQHH3FZ>_

• Justin is bullish on using TEEs for security improvement everywhere (in ethereum).
• If Flashbots ships remote attestation for TEEs it would be huge for the space.
• TEE-boost: using TEEs to bypass relays is a good idea.
• Validators accepting TEEs as feasible, only downside is memetic risk for Ethereum as people misunderstand security improvement usage of TEEs.
• Open TEE hardware R&D, EF funded VDF ASICs team (Supernatural) came from Intel, is a good start to talk to, tech lead Kelly is working with TEEs.
• L2 as R&D sandboxes for Execution Tickets: based rollups (Taiko, potentially app rollups like ENS), Espresso sequencer marketplace, Puffer Finance.
• Justin is shipping an Ethereum Endgame Spec (ideal functionalities in one spec, like ETH3.0) to advocate for accelerated development potentially via a clean slate (Beacon Chain playbook)

• A bunch of TEE manufacturers don't have remote attestation, only a subset do. (e.g. AWS, eg Puffer is using this), why is this the case?
• Does TDX has remote attestations?
    ◦ If remote attestation is possible with TDX, why didn't Intel have it themselves?
• What's the catch with TDX if the performance is so good? What’s the trade-off?

|   On TEE questions:
• A bunch of TEE manufacturers don't have remote attestation, only a subset do. (e.g. AWS, eg Puffer is using this), why is this the case?
    ◦ I think he's asking about dcap here so I'll summon <@U06TCT3U00N> 
• Does TDX has remote attestations?
    ◦ Yes (DCAP), but it's more complex than in SGX. There's also cloud attestation which is different than remote attestation - allows to attest the enclave runs in a datacenter. See Frieder's excellent post on <https://collective.flashbots.net/t/tee-engineering-part-1-cloud-attestations-advantages-shortcomings-solutions/3514|Azure TDX attestations>.
    ◦ We can still use DCAP remote attestations with bare metal TDX (right <@U06TCT3U00N>?)
• What's the catch with TDX if the performance is so good? What’s the trade-off?
    ◦ One would be that the trusted compute base (TCB) - what's running in the enclave - is much bigger as it includes the whole VM. 
    ◦ Why I think it's so much faster is that the above lets the code not constantly exit the enclave for each OS call as in SGX, rather with TDX we only exit whenever we access virtualized hardware (we exit to the hypervisor)

From a platformist viewpoint, the best opportunity here is a collaboration between Flashbots and Cycles (Informal Systems) to make SUAVE have eth and cosmos.
But from a product perspective no one should want this, it's a rabbithole timesink without customers but ++coordination cost, resources are directed to focus on customer needs (builders and solvers for suave, Fintech accounts payable for Cycles)

I chatted with kevin from SCP a bit today. He raised some good questions about smart multiplexing that may be important for us to consider in messaging and how we design the UX. We also talked a bit about the “PFOF RPCs” (merkle, blink) — how they work, impact on builders, possible customer for pareto builder.

Smart multiplexing
• Kevin raised a concern that not immediately forwarding orderflow to builders that users has selected would “jeopardize inclusion and go against the user’s intentions”.
• SCP previously called out titan for a case like this. Specifically Bananagun is happy with Titan withholding snipes (because they get massive refunds) but not other transactions (because they want fast inclusion). At one point Titan was withholding all of them, and SCP called them out.
• Kevin worried that we are also ignoring users’ intent if we smart multiplex all Protect flow.
• My initial response is that this is really a question of user intent. We have many users who just want to outsource the problem of balancing inclusion speed and refunds to us. Smart multiplexing by default makes sense for that case. But it is worth noting that there are some instances where users manually configure their RPC, and we may want to consider making smart multiplexing more of a feature choice (eg. opt in/out) for them.
• Also clarified that smart multiplexing is not supposed to result in worse inclusion. I think this was not immediately clear to SCP.
PFOF RPCs
• We also talked about the deals that blink and merkle have where they charge builders to receive flow. Specifically builders pay a monthly refund on prio fees if they landed a block including txs from this RPC. It’s like MEVBlocker.
• Kevin noted that this can have adverse effects on inclusion. The RPCs fully expect the builder to only treat the prio fee for the tx at the reduced post-refund %. Eg user tx pays 1 ETH in prio fees, merkle kickback is 75%, then builders will just treat the tx as if it paid .25 ETH. This can hurt inclusion or block position.
• According to him builders don’t really benefit from this. I thought that was interesting. Why would they pay for it then :smile:
• I floated the idea that these “PFOF RPCs” could be good customers for the pareto builder. This model where builders pay up front for flow doesn’t seem optimally efficient. The dynamic around inclusion you would get with retroactive refunds based on excess prio fees seems somewhat preferable for the user. Kevin agreed. I poked that it could be interesting to make a case here — we likely need to model the impact on revenue for the RPC provider as part of that.
• (cc <@U02CJ9QVAL9> a bit more data on the merkle mechanism, since they haven’t replied to us yet)
Tossed this in the CRM for posterity <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Shea-Kevin-chat-3fc49b43cd73424886c3fce71118a653>
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 11/06/2024 18:37:32 Z:
|   They pay for the flow because paying for the flow leaves them in the status quo and not paying while others pay leaves them worse off
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 13/06/2024 14:23:07 Z:
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> I think Merkle is not going to reply because the ask we made is pretty non-trivial in terms of time and it's not perceived as worth their time (given our inclusion rates relative to the bigger builders). What do you think about just going ahead and signing up for them and Blink?

@ ZuBerlin: I checked in Simon Brown this morning and chatted for a few minutes. He said Linea is down to crunch time to make a sequencing decision, and he’s come here this week to make that decision. He is internally advocating for based but no one else internally is for it. He likes the composability to other based rollups but is scared there will only be a couple and the big rollups (OP, Arb) won’t go for it 

> Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 12/06/2024 08:41:51 Z:
I chatted to Amir, the co-founder of Puffer today.

- Puffer is building a staking pool where permissionless NOs are in TEE. They use the TEE for several things, which is where it becomes interesting:
- Prevent slashing, which in turn lowers the cost of bonding to 1 ETH.
- Their strategy is vertical integration. Next step is launch own rollup that is also sequenced by the same validators. Usually, you need a fair share of validators for this (e.g. 30-40%+) but with TEEs, they can give credible instant preconfs.
- Finally, they want to give synchronous composability between L1 and their own L2.
- Maybe most importantly, they use the TEE to implement a version of execution tickets. I didn't fully grasp this, but its probably similar to <@U03HT20PJES> idea. So they fall into what <@U03GRQX5HGR> called the L1 experimentation lab (or sth like that), similar strategy to Espresso.

Spoke with Apriori from Anoma

*What is Anoma*
- not a blockchain, not really a SDK. More like a horizontally scalable network for making any state transition in Ethereum happen. Sitting between user intent and Ethereum txn, translating the two through solver network. "intent engine"
- It means Anoma is building SUAVE, OG vision, now! They also fully pivoted from Cosmos to Ethereum, see clearer GTM there
I pushed him a bit on this pivot but he was tight lipped.
- Recommended reading: <https://ethresear.ch/t/rfc-draft-anoma-as-the-universal-intent-machine-for-ethereum/19109>

*what is Namada*
- Privacy chain with shielded asset pools
- its UTXO + ZK based, that's how they do privacy
- Not super clear how this relates to Anoma but its built in-house

*Privacy in Anoma*
- Private solving important
- TEE most promising, but expect there will be a market based solution available, that's why they are actively researching MPC themselves (Imo a very interesting/smart approach from a portfolio perspective)

*Anoma GTM*
- Focused very much on Ethereum rollups
- thinking about a validator sidecar (imo super low odds of that working)
- I didn't understand this part very well -- read the post if you want to learn more
- Expect testnets over next year, and then mainnet sometime in 25

*Leadership structure*
- Chris Goes is their visionary type founder. He writes some code, but mostly handles vision, BD, and legal.
- Second in command is the classic operator type, an Asian or African name woman. She is very private, but keeps trains running on time.
- Apriori -- part of leadership and head of research relationships
- Strategy is done together by leadership

*Heliax labs*
- around 50 people now, most of them researchers. 8-10 engineers (?)
- Research + Product Orgs
- They focus + accountability strategy is "1 offsite and 1 spec per quarter": Research writes specs, product implemenents, but its a dialogue. They use offsites to make concrete commitments, then meet again after 3 months. Every sprint produces 1 spec.
- Are not working with external developers at all, developing purely based on vision. Expect that to change within 3-6mo.
- Research teams: Distributed Systems, Resource Machine, Programming Language Design. They all have very clear responsibilities that must result in specs.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 14/06/2024 12:42:11 Z:
|   It's an interesting spin on the concept of an R+D organization. Super high focus + accountability. Very clear mutual responsibilities between R+D, they have invested much into making that interface work.
Probably optimizes for very different tradeoffs compared to us

|   (Second in command) - I met her in Prague, asked about Namada, she said that it is all abkut Data Protection and not privacy
|   Also she mentioned TEEs and then after a while cut the conversation maybe not wanting to disclose too much
|   She has been organizing these hotel homestyle parties where people come invited - they rent the biggest hotel room, and use it instead of events.

|   I think highly of all the people involved individually and of their collaboration on Anoma/Nemada/Heliax. Really interesting to hear they are converging on something that looks close to the og suave vision, thanks for sharing notes :raised_hands:. Re: their r&d structure- my intuition is that the type of structure they built could incline them to build the ‘perfect/ideal’ solution rather than the right one, similarly to academic prototypes that continue to function like university research labs while building a product as a company. The dynamic to avoid then can be- seeking the perfect solution to the hard technical problem is so appealing to the deciders that it is hard to maintain perspective and prioritization, so there needs to be checks and balances there 
|   
|   > Tomasz Stańczak [U03G4UY5NN9] @ 14/06/2024 15:42:27 Z:
|   For me it is more like if you placed anoma and flashbots style next to each other - they look similar. Anoma seems more like Parity, flashbots feels more like Ethereum

*Notes from OP Labs CoWorking Day, slightly structured as we're still hacking sorry:*
• Attendees: Sarah, Jinsuk, Dmarz
*Strategy Related:*
• Now that fault proofs have shipped, OP decided at their offsite that Interop is their #1 priority
    ◦ Their #2 priority is to move all convos out of DM and out into the open. They created a protocol R&D discord that they added us to, along with committing to posting all design docs and standups on GitHub.
    ◦ Mark described our effort to Karl as “the first users of interop”
• When asked how Proto “feels about the interop spec”, he gave a small sigh and roughly said: it’s mostly done but there are two high level issues which are not solved but feel attainable and not fundamental.
• Our feedback on the usability of interop spec from the perspective of a block builder was very much appreciated and specifically collapsed two areas of design choices that they were unsure of. 
    ◦ After our jam I heard Proto mention in two other convos in the room that “Flashbots is building the low latency version”.
• The meme of "L2 PBS" came up multiple times and they we're very receptive to my concerns around not replicating L1 PBS but we need to do more work here on educating.
• They have internal agreement and buy-in for a Devcon Demo collab with Flashbots and our next step is to propose a design document for that architecture, the sexier the better to help them sell interop to the rest of the superchain.
• Mark expressed some slight fear around the uncertainty of Conduits intention. If current trends continue it’s possible that Conduit runs a majority of the chains in the super chain and OP wants to know more about what they will do with all of that order flow. Also said he “welcomes competition” if Conduit were to decide to run their own version of the super chain.
    ◦ I brought up that Conduit is spinning up a testnet with our Builder API fork just so there we're no surprises but told him we're interested in making sure our solution is ideal for all parties and would be willing to lend a hand in making sure Conduit is aligned with OP.
• I heard from multiple OP people the idea of “wanting to avoid an Espresso monopoly on sequencing rights”, I didn’t dig into this more than that. 
• OP will never add bundles to their geth fork, and generally any features, unless they are added to the L1 geth. This partially relaxes our concerns around sequencer defensibility.
*Technology Related:*
• Proto is exploring “shreds” as a way for coordinating cross-chain messages. <https://github.com/solana-foundation/specs/blob/main/p2p/shred.md|Shreds> are pioneered in blockchains via Solana but look like traditional streaming with cryptographic commitments to blockchain state. The idea is that sequencers can send parts of the block as its being constructed to an append only log managed by the “super chain backend” which would give other sequencers confidence that an initiating interop message was included on the source chain. (remember that sequencers trust each other and could grief each other by claiming to include an initiating message, rugging it, and making the other chains block invalid).  Proto currently envisions this log as requiring no execution so it’s lightweight and also as having the ability to be “reset” a few seconds if a MEV optimized sequencer constructs a better ordering. 
    ◦ Sarah and I got pretty nerd sniped by this and wrote a minimal shred spec that we could implement in the SUAVE sequencer.
    ◦ We gave Proto the idea of making the append-only log a DAG so that multiple block builders could build from it and he apparently got very nerd sniped by this and brought it up during their internal protocol meeting. Karl and Mark ended up coming over and asking about the idea even.
    ◦ Shreds could also be used to give users pre-confirmations! But this comes at the cost of not being able to “rewrite” the commitment, so it has trade-offs. I believe this will be a very interesting design space for us to collaborate on.
    ◦ The append only superchain log is in many ways a bulletin chain, but they are using it for synchronization, not censorship resistance. They also have no plans to make it a distributed protocol, at least not for a while. This gives even more fuel to the fire for us to open up our design convos around bulletin chains and the work we gave a grant to common prefix for.
• OP Stack won’t add bundles but it should be noted that Robert has told me there is an L2 reference geth being worked on with all of the RIPs implemented and it’s possible that someone could add a bundle type RIP and get added to all L2s. It’s unlikely OP would use this reference geth though, but wanted to add some nuance.
• Mark really wants a service which can take a users intent and handling creating and submitting interop messages on their behalf which is very similar to the PoC we have been working on during Crucible.
• We told them that having the builder insert the log index for cross chain messages is basically untenable so they’re going to ship a modification to the spec which allows for users to put a wild card for the log index and allow the sequencer to fill it in at the end of the block as an event transaction. 
• Demo idea we came up with is a live cross chain message chat room where we will have two chatrooms with messages coming from their own rollup. User’s could then type “cross-chain(“hello”)” and see the message be sent to the other chatroom. If we have time we could make this usable by anyone mobile in the audience by creating insecure browser hosted public keys and signing an intent format.
• The boundary between our software and their vision for interop/the op protocol still has some work to be defined. During jamming it was clear there were things we thought we would do that they thought they would, and vice versa! I don’t think this is an issue but jamming more closely will become crucial to avoid unnecessary work.

I ran into ce in the office today and we talked about a couple things related to orderflow, block building, pareto builder.

*PFOF OFAs*
• Blink and merkle have ~10k tx/day each which is non trivial
• They pay the OF providers who submit to them 5 cents per tx ($500/day)
• Ce doesn’t know who the ultimate OF providers are who are using blink and merkle
• His personal take is “this is annoying I want to stop doing it”
*Redistribution*
• In his opinion this is the hardest and most interesting problem to think about for the pareto builder
• One challenge is what builder algorithm to resimulate with, and against what data. In contentious blocks we may need to run a low latency algo that is fast but does not produce the most profitable block. If we calculate allocation rule with another algo it could create better blocks. Which algo should we use?
    ◦ IMO we have to take it as premise that the builder needed to win the block. So we can only realistically resimulate with algos that could have worked in the precise scenario we were in. If the builder deemed that this was the best algo to run, we should use it for resims too. Ce was supportive of this.
    ◦ We also need to make sure we’re re-evaluating against the bundle data that was actually available. Ce suggests timestamping the bundle pool when the bundle merging run begins and referencing this.
    ◦ It also could be bad if the builder algo is nondeterministic.
• One other challenge he cares about is how to handle people multiplexing and not sending exclusively. I offered some reasons why this isn’t incentive compatible and should be dissuaded in the metagame; he seemed somewhat but not fully convinced. We should dig into this more.
• We talked about what it could look like to evaluate if our allocation rule works. Ideally we would be able to test our code against some example blocks, especially the “hard” ones with tg bot or cex dex flow. Unfortunately flashbots is unlikely to have won those blocks or have the unlanded bundle data.
    ◦ But SCP does! I suggested we could send our code to SCP and have them run it against their own data. Ce was excited about this idea. Then we can see in practice what the impact of the rule is — who makes more, less, iterate from there.
    ◦ It’s also a nice way for SCP to understand what their outcomes will look like. Specifically how much less money they would end up making.
• Finally he was curious how we can do redistribution trustlessly. “If flashbots has all the bundle data then you’re the only ones who can execute the redistribution rule”. I suggested that we could have an encrypted DA shared between the TEE nodes or something like SUAVE bulletin chains in the future. He thought this was really cool.
*Collaborating*
• I also poked a bit on how we can move our collaboration with SCP forward
• Ce feels like this is blocked on the “higher ups” at SCP deciding to adopt pareto
    ◦ Notably he doesn’t think the problem is flashbots demonstrating we can iterate quickly anymore, it’s more an internal decision. That’s pretty cool to hear.
• Personally ce is keen to move on from owning their builder day to day
    ◦ He’s interested in questions like “how does the pareto builder affect PBS? what’s the plan for success after it gets adoption”? (I laid out some of our thoughts on TEE boost, he thought removing OF deals was the most compelling part of the vision)
    ◦ He also thinks redistribution is a hard problem and is interested to jam on that more
Also as some alpha he hinted that they don’t receive bundles from jared anymore. Not sure what happened.

Got Dinner with Kydo from Eigen Layer yesterday:
• He's stepping into head of strategy/chief of staff of Eigen Layer Foundation
• Will have a large war chest and wants to collaborate with us, we discussed starting a community call around Short Term Censorship Resistance (Bulletin Chains) and then also collaborating around using Eigen Slashing in Kettles and Commit Boost
• Commit Boost story from his POV: Kydo joined Eigen as a "glorified blog" writer and was told to look into creating a "Proposer Commitment Platform" bc it would need staking/slashing + market was "ripe for disruption" -> he wrote a few blog posts on MEV-Boost++ and related PEPC ideas but nothing ever landed -> they dropped looking into it but gave Drew a grant to pick it up -> was surprised a few months later that it his commit boost proposal was gaining traction -> decided to throw some weight behind it and support it officially.
• Eigen Layer does not have Open Source Software as a core value, took me a while to convince Kydo that having open source builder implementations of all of these complicated proposer commitments is good because it lowers barriers to entry and allows for innovation. (side note: someone dm'ed me recently that all of the AVS implementations are closed source, so this sort of checks out.)
• I ended on a very positive note that we're down to collaborate and tried to keep door open as much as possible on commit-boost.

|   Had a thought the other week that we could do a collab with EigenDA to solve the data availability problem in TEE-Boost. The answer to this problem might ultimately be a SUAVE bulletin chain, but it gives a more concrete and PBS-related use case to start with and then generalize from there to SUAVE platform. Wonder if they’d be nerdsnipable on this

Call with Fireblocks - Jude Zhu, director of institutional business (Singapore)

Tldr;
• Jude is LTPʻs contact at Fireblocks. Ethan from LTP introduced us over TG.
• LTP would like to integrate Protect but uses Fireblocks. Jude agrees that this is the best way to implement the RPC is via friendly, mutual client.
• Integration is dependent on the partnership and architecture team. Both are busy with a liquid staking project.  Jude will connect FB with the correct people at Fireblocks.
Action items:
• Added <@U03PZSSETQA> and <@U05DY4WTLUB> to the chat. Ethan from LTP is in the chat as well.
• Waiting for Jude to provide Fireblocks contacts.

I talked to Privy a bit more, they added us to their list of integrations in their docs officially. Privy integrations choose their RPC, and they do offer a default, but they weren't ready to switch over to us for that. They'd rather just nudge their customers to choose. Moreover, L1 is a relatively small portion of their usage, so it kind of makes sense.

They have an issue which is being able to estimate gas prices across many different types of L2s. We can't immediately help there, but we might be able to in the long run.

Call with <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Coolwallet-June-19-2024-f5b7277e7155466e8ed22133a5369675|Coolwallets> - Wesley Wen, technical director. Joe Huang, wallet project manager.

tldr;
They will be integrating Flashbots Protect to their wallet solution.  <@U05DY4WTLUB> is supporting via the Telegram channel that we have with Wesley and Joe.

Team
• CoolBitx has roughly 50 people based in Taipei. They have 25 product and engineering members and around 20 people working on CoolWallet.
MEV Questions
• They were using the Merkle website ( <https://mevback.cash|mevback.cash> ) to estimate mev losses. They wondered how they could gauge how much MEV affects their customers since not all their customers conduct large swap transactions.
• They were concerned about pending transactions or identifying which transactions will revert. George sent Protect status api docs to them. They also use other indexers for pending transactions -<https://subsquid.io> .
• They were interested in the revert protection and also the upcoming priority gas refunds.
• They wanted to know if there were any co-marketing opportunities. I redirected them to the upcoming Protect Explorer but they felt they would be lower on the board since they have less wallets than Metamask. I said they could use the dashboard Protect savings and calculate a Protect savings per wallet with their wallet information. Also mentioned maybe a Protectoor badge they could use on their website (tbd).
Research
• Wesley is interested in account abstraction and intents.

Ethos (a company that was doing restaking for Cosmos, spinoff by a Polychain GP) is pivoting to do TEEs with the angle of “initiating HTTP calls from inside the enclave.”  They are building a PoC for this and based on my EF friend’s comment “they are more informed than other TEE AVS and hired an ex-Amazon guy who defended nitro hard.

I talked to Nathan Worsely, former searcher and former consultant to Flashbots. *He has a new venture, basically a "perp-dex first" but "more general intent trading and execution engine later."* He is funded by Paradigm, and wants to build this on SUAVE as a flagship product. The caveat is that we need to offer high throughput have the right timeline. He's looking at Monad as an alternative, but he doesn't want to be "the monad perp-dex protocol" and instead wants to build something more grand. He's TEE and SUAVE pilled generally, and I think we could close him on it.

To me I find the idea of Nathan's startup being a SUAVE core dev and helping make the platform sick for intents/trading pretty compelling. The next step is for us to huddle at ETHCC. He needs to convince his CTO and he needs assurances on timeline and that he'd have insight into our product roadmaps, discussions, etc.

call with Lev readout:
• *quote: "these calls have been immensely useful for me to go back to my team and be able to say with confidence that we're going to do something here"*
• we talked for awhile about who runs the pareto builder nodes and how that relates to economics *- this is a key question to be figured out*
• we talked about the narrative behind the pareto builder and how to frame it, Lev is worried that the community will react negatively and we need a 1 liner answer for why "this isn't a centralized monopoly" - *this is key for us to own and drive*
    ◦ deriving from this line of inquiry, we arrived at "it's in a TEE and is operated by multiple parties" and this being a *critical feature* - we should call the "pareto builder MVP" a system with multiple operators
• we talked about orderflow adoption and incentives/bootstrapping
• we talked about how to work together and what would get them excited: the answer is "line of sight" on a "spec" and a list of hard open problems, like the economics of node operators and who runs nodes as one example
FLUPs:
• I'm talking to Lev again next thursday
• I'll go around and put together a list of open problems for the pareto builder and start building some momentum towards a spec

I spoke to a friend of Flashbots (who prefers to remain anonymous) who shipped Blast sequencer. Here is a brief read out. <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03PZSSETQA> 
• Blast is an OPstack fork (not implemented by Conduit), and is not part of Superchain.
• Blast is operating its own vanilla sequencer, and has no plan to decentralize the sequencer at the moment.
• Dont care about preconfs or Interop at the moment.
•  Working on L2 gas refunds at the moment, it's complex. 
• Core goal for Blast chain - accrue more yield.
• Get more MEV - they are currently putting a lot of eth into lido, but instead they can run eth validator and get the additional MEV and pay it back to users.
• Painpoint: need to find a private blob space market! 
• Open to running sequencers in a TEE.

Spoke to Akaki from Offchain Labs (Arbitrum)
• they plan to publish a blob space VCG auction proposal on their forum early next week <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
• they have implemented most of the code which will be open sourced, and is reaching out to get more rollups to adopt it
• anyone can adopt this, though builders will likely implement this <@U03PZSSETQA> 
• right now it's not sealed bid bc VCG is already incentive compatible and okay if rollups are not adversarial in this market 
• open to collaborate on using TEE to turn it into a sealed bid auction, seems useful if we assume rollups are adversarial

|   I pressed deeper and he said they don’t necessarily want physically settled blobspace futures, just need a way to hedge, a simple derivative with an oracle on blobspace price could work. The problem is liquidity/finding counterparty. I suggested selling this as a retail lp farm and he was receptive

|   Nice. Been chatting with terrence about this. I’m pretty sure we could easily support the builder end by just asking rolllups to send to the private transaction API on fast mode. This could be a fairly good source of flow so tracking closely

|   <@U03PZSSETQA> is this a privacy issue? I thought it was a blob propagation issue in which case putting it in one builders private mempool would make it worse no? (theres also no good biding language AFAIU which is the other problem)
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 28/06/2024 15:35:19 Z:
|   The big problem they’re seeing is that EL clients have restrictive rules about how you can send blobs eg
• One sender per tx per nonce -> only get one shot to post blobs so have to choose a priori if you try to land 6 vs 5 vs 4… in a slot
• Expensive to replace tip
• Also suspect; mempool propagation slow (centralized db faster), blobs sometimes getting ejected, etc
The idea is that
1. All the rollups could send all sorts of combos and pricings of blobs
2. Private mempool’s value is it will just hold onto everything (“looser” rules)
3. And, we multiplex all these out to all the builders (eg via fast mode)
4. So then it just comes down to builders merging them but think a regular merging algo will handle this so we should get it out of the box

I talked with medha (PM @ uniswap) today about the roadmap for uniswap wallet and extension in Q3. *Uniswap has decided to prioritize migrating from MEVBlocker to Protect in early Q3*. We talked about what concretely that integration will look like and chatted casually about the rest of their upcoming plans. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Chat-with-Medha-about-uniswap-protect-integration-d0a916f5ecdd4b718aee0a313b5e0244>

Roadmap and requirements
• *[p0] Uniswap wants us to support getTransactionCount for pending private transactions*. This isn’t strictly necessary for the integration to work because MEVBlocker doesn’t support it either, but it is a blocker for them to migrate because that requires work and they (fairly) want something in return.
• [p2] They’re interested in priority fee refunds but it’s not blocking to migrating to Protect. Medha isn’t actually sure if they accept MEV refunds from MEVBlocker because of legal issues, so she’s checking on that. We agreed it would be great to collaborate on UX requirements for claiming refund if they’re able to accept them.
• [FYI] The other big things they’re working on this quarter after shipping the new extension are in-app bridging for the wallet and extension, and shipping unichain (which will be the default onboarding experience for wallet and extension users).
Other (good) news
• Uniswap is shipping a new chrome extension on july 16. *They’ll be sending flow from the wallet _and_ the new extension to Protect!*
• It looks like *Protect is the only option they’re seriously considering*; her questions were all tactical about how we integrate and not about how they should choose a provider.
• Medha asked if we could help define metrics they should monitor to check if the integration is going well. One thing that we might be able to show an improvement vs mevblocker on is the number of hints shared. Privacy and security are top priorities for them, so medha liked that idea. We also agreed on measuring inclusion speed and uptime.
Actions
• Flashbots: Confirm design for getTransactionCount and share a rough timeline / any high level questions with Uniswap. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Include-private-txs-in-eth_getTransactionCount-344f17fb619a43709c09d7c42a42f9df|We’ve previously looked into this> and I believe it should be straightforward, the only nuance is ensuring that the endpoint is secure so we don’t leak info about pending transactions to someone who doesn’t control an account.
• Uniswap: Confirm if they currently are able to receive refunds and any requirements we should be aware of.
• Both: Connect engineering owners to jam on design in a few weeks.

|   I think there is inconsistency (both internal and external) in the messaging of

"open source builder to lower barriers to entry in the builder market, make it easier for searchers to spin up their own builder"

and

"launch pareto builder to centralize the builder market in a decentralized entity, and remove the need for searchers to have to run a builder".

> Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 02/07/2024 23:26:28 Z:
I had a casual chat with Max from SMG (MM) at edge city.

• he views users as dumb and doesn't think they should get any share of auction revenue
• his view on the MM auction is that it works for the market they have. He reiterated they are willing to switch to a builder that gives refunds
• he completely rejects the framing of MM needing to further decentralisation or the ideals of the space in favour of "we're a business with a bunch of costs, not enough revenue and a finite time horizon"
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 03/07/2024 08:10:19 Z:
|   Switching to a builder that gives refunds is a nice mid-term signal. I wouldn't bet the farm on it but we will see

|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 03/07/2024 23:59:58 Z:
|   most obvious ones are
• open up their auction rules and data so that people can analyse and have an open discussion
• remove the legal barrier to participation
|   
|   > Tomasz Stańczak [U03G4UY5NN9] @ 04/07/2024 06:09:01 Z:
|   I listened to Max at the Paradigm event talking to a few people around us and also had a very bad impression of him (but thought it was just me). His discussion on EIP-1559 with Ansgar was definitely in Ansgar's favour.
At the same time my impression was that he would himself regret this behaviour when he grows up and that he may be looking for some confidence boost.
|   As for MM - yes, seems very cynical to talk about users and decentralization this way. Would be two the only two pillars to hang the product on.

Quick call with Wigwam - web3 wallet
contact - Volo Klykov (cmo)

tldr;
They are interested in integrating with Protect and will reach out once their developers meet a few milestones in a few weeks.  Created a TG channel with them <@U05DY4WTLUB>.

Team
• 7 people , 2 marketers 5 developers
• registered in UK, team is distributed but mainly portugal
Chains
• Ethereum, Avalance, BNB, Polygon, Arbitrum, Linea, Blast, Base, Optimism
Business
• They have a TG game with 5mm users that they are aiming to redirect to their mobile application
• Their wallet has 30k installations. They do not keep address information to prevent the collection of IP data.
• 2 main products - need to decide which to focus on
    ◦ wallet - for web3 users
    ◦ web application for web2 users


> Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 04/07/2024 12:35:40 Z:
*[Confidential*] Spoke to a Libevm, they have a lot of searcher flows including (including biggest non-integrated searchers), as well as all wallets that multiplexes through the pfof rpc.
• Metamask smart tx & shitty OF game
    ◦ Based on the current Metamask smart tx mechanism, unless you have your own flow (on top of all searchers and of) you just won't win anyways and straight up lose money. Extremely centralizing force.
    ◦ Metamask smart tx roll out causing their Penguin builder market share to drop from 2% to 0.3% in a month.
• CEX-DEX is their new focus, currently 10 tokens w 6 figure capital, will scale up.
    ◦ They started running their new CEX-DEX already.
    ◦ They are happy to send their CEX-DEX flow to Flashbots builder when we are ready, to help our bootstrap. 
• rBuilder open source, rust 
    ◦ They liked our rBuilder, but mentioned the current vanilla builder without strategic bidding will not help live players in prod, because without strategic bidding .
    ◦ They started out writing their builder in rust, but returned to Geth, because basically the state root calc in Rust is 2 orders of magnitude worse than the Geth builder in the highly dynamic adjustments.
        ▪︎ is this why the SCP builder is in Geth instead of Rust?
• They are fundraising still, same 30m valuation, pre TS, target lead is bybit's investment, happy to take flashbots funding in any shape - happy to take on any grants and consulting contracts could work, need us to scope projects out. 
Note from Tina: seeing how screwed the OF game is for small guys like them, they were upset, TEE builder can banded together searchers like him without needing to trust each other

Meeting with Rabby with <@U03PZSSETQA> on 07/04 (Notes <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Meeting-with-rabby-076e750a70434385ba4fc0a8d27871cc?pvs=4|here>)

• Rabby Priorities
    ◦ The biggest concern is robustness.
    ◦ The second priority is generating revenue through MEV refunds.
• UX Preference: Maintain the same user experience as if no private mempool solution is used, such as no Flashbots Protect tagline on Etherscan.
• They feel more comfortable if they can multiplex to make the system more robust and avoid a single point of failure.
    ◦ This is reasonable because even with the largest cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, we still use a multi-cloud setup.
    ◦ It remains a question whether they will continue to multiplex or use one exclusively and keep other options as backup. Will monitor and follow up with this.
    ◦ If they continue with multiplexing, it is advantageous for us because MEV-Blocker admitted their security model is unsound when multiplexed.
• Right now, they are sending all the flow. They might switch to sending swap only later.
• Features Rabby plans to add:
    ◦ MEV protection/refund solution on L2, as users are becoming more active on popular L2 chains.
    ◦ Solutions on other EVM chains like Polygon and BNB.
• Other OFAs they have been discussing with:
    ◦ MEV-Blocker wants them to do it exclusively and emphasized that their security model does not work when multiplexed.
    ◦ Blink is offering priority fee refunds.
    ◦ Merkle said they are working on it for Polygon and BNB but don’t have anything in production yet.
Action Items
• They want us to get rid of the flashbots logo on etherscan for their txs because users see it and think it is slow (even though it isn’t lol). <https://linear.app/flashbots/issue/CUS-86/remove-mentioning-of-flashbots-in-etherscan-integration|Linear Ticket>
• What is the best answer we have to the counterfactual question “suppose that Rabby has sent the flow to us exclusively for the past half month, what is our best estimate of the refund we could have generated”? We still don’t have a good answer.
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 06/07/2024 05:43:32 Z:
|   Is there no robustness solution where they send to us and then after some timeout send to others or the mempool?
|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 06/07/2024 13:20:33 Z:
|   What I am getting is that they do not want to use just one single provider as that creates a single point of failure. But using one exclusively and then having backup you can turn on very quickly seems fine to me.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 06/07/2024 17:22:22 Z:

|   ~both Yaz and Jake probably in 6 months imo~
My prediction is Yaz in 6 months or so imo, Jake will likely be interested in Flashbots in general - role doesn't matter, but he still needs to solve Celestia positioning issues, which we discussed quite a while - he likes to think of themselves as AWS, I kindly reminded him Celestia does not have population of users or native use case, ETH L1 is much more like AWS - have "domestic demand" ... 
my troll analogy which likens Celestia to a efficient factory churning out cool gadgets but have to export to other ecosystem... but likely rejected by each ecosystems immune system, so need to be able to wait out a few cycles and avoid duration mismatch... hence at best economy of scale, no network effect
Separately we jammed a bit on the cloud analogy Celestia likes to use, he finds Flashbots as owning the stack and Celestia as general hosting service to be an interesting angle

|   Really frustrating we lost this one and without a fight with Coinbase Wallet it seems. Ben turning out to be not as deft internally as Viktor it seems 
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 07/07/2024 09:54:13 Z:
|   My guess given prior convos is that they may be swayed by MEVBlocker’s higher revenue. But I feel this needs to be caveated and put in context

OFA refunds
1. Both OFAs have the ~same average refund value per refunded tx
2. MEVBlocker refunds look higher in large part because they have exclusive deal w uniswap and cowswap, you need to exclude this to get an accurate picture of what results will be like for your flow
3. They also have a higher refund incidence, this may be the one thing we lose on, but would want to check how much it’s impacted by (2)
Other revenue streams
1. MEVBlocker’s revenue is entirely dependent on builders paying them in a hacky cumbersome side channel fashion while pareto builder gas fee refunds are not
2. MEVBlocker also has made it incredibly annoying for builders to integrate and recently has just been awful to communicate with; I think a coup is not off the table (main issue is beaver’s link to them combined with high market share)
3. MEVBlocker also takes 50% of this rev stream while we would not take a cut of gas fee refunds
Been meaning to make a case for us playing hard ball here and get more data to evaluate the impact of cutting off our PFOF deal. But will put this hear while in middle of ethCC stuff

|   One other thing that occurs to me is that MEVBlocker is actually incentivized to have builders misbehave because they can charge big fines for it. This creates a conflict of interest vs their users
|   Unless those fines are purely being funneled to the users, which I’m not sure of

Chatted with the operations lead for Protocol Guild while waiting for my flight this morning. 

He said they’ve finally got their cayman entity set up, starting their fundraising, goal for ethcc is to get a few commitments for Tim Beiko’s 1% token supply pledge. He said Taiko and EtherFi have already signed up. 

He asked some questions about how FB was thinking about the new ePBS EIP, I didn’t really give a direct answer other than it’s good to see the efforts now organized under and EIP.

Dinner with EF AA researchers - Nico Csgy and Eric Sui

• Ledger Live team handles a significant amount of transfers and swaps (1/3 of ledger volume) and the team has no bandwidth for MEV protection.  <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U05DY4WTLUB> 
• Coinbase uses <https://smoo.th|smooth>ʻs tech for the AA passkeys.  Smooth is in stealth -> <https://github.com/get-smooth|github>.

[*Confidential] Scroll is decentralizing their sequencer this year, and they are doing a sprint in the meeting room at our ETHcc hotel.*
• They are very keen to jam on decentralized sequencing designs, eg. having PBS / MEV-Boost on Scroll, and blockbuilding.
• They were the first to implement multiple-prover designs with TEE and been running for a while. Their belief is without muktiprover with TEE proofs, you cannot have true sequencer decentralization. <@U055KQHH3FZ> <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
• I ask them to lay out the contrast of their TEE multiprover aproach with Taiko's in our TEE section of Modular Summit. 
• We have scheduled a deep dive 1:1 with Scroll in the next few days for <@U05BMHJMRNK> and team.
I expect Scroll will be making decision on their sequencer decentralization design as early as this week based on our feedback, and can in turn determine SUAVE role in their decentralization roadmap.

|   I jammed with their team a bunch before so I have context here (it should be searchable in this channel)

Before they were more excited to work with us on offering 0 gas price txs on the chains that fork their code (their equivalent of the OP-Stack, I think) rather than having us on the main chain - which would come later

Also received caution from Georgios on betting on them because they have historically not been the most put together technically (e.g. they could not produce a spec that detailed their chain's difference to the normal ETH evm so that the reth team could implement scroll-reth).

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 08/07/2024 10:39:34 Z:
|   I think GK is in general skeptical of any non-mainstream twitter popular projects tbh. 
It is very clear to me they have to do it now this year, because they literally need to decentralize during this market cycle. So it is a clear: time is NOW situation. 
That said, this does not mean whether we prioritize the or not, I just want to lay out what I do best - read the wind, if we want, they can ship.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 08/07/2024 10:41:35 Z:
|   Reminder that we previously identified Scroll as the most likely early adopter for us, 1) because they already trust TEEs, 2) their differentiation as a blockchain is decentralization, 3) they are lagging in terms of adoption and need to make bold moves.
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 08/07/2024 10:42:27 Z:

|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 08/07/2024 10:46:10 Z:
|   I’m open minded but I share GKs technical skepticism. As another data point, they were the only major rollup provider not prepared for 4844 - an event that was well known beforehand. It’s not a reason in and of itself to not work with them, but it does give me pause and would factor into any roadmapping and timelines we make.
|   
|   > Ferran [U05K746EU4F] @ 08/07/2024 11:02:29 Z:
|   There is a possible "simple" path of integration here where we do not commit a lot of resources. We continue as plan with our rbuilder sequencer for opstack. Then, if reth supports zkscroll, it could be an "easy" drop in replacement for us to have an rbuilder-scroll-sequencer out of the box.

ETHcc L2 GTM
Caldera is EXCITED to work with us. <@U05BMHJMRNK> has great notes. My takeaway here before I forget.
• Their focus is on appchains.
• Their forte is Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem. they have Bored Apes, Treasure Island, lots of gaming.
• On OP they have Manta (7th largest TVL on L2 beat)
• Takes a consulting and customized approach. 
• They are excited for:
    ◦ sandboxing interop builder on chains they sequence
    ◦ provide us insights into what L2 ecosystems actually want
    ◦ co-create solutions
• They can sell our OP PBS to their customers right away. 
There are a lot of insights about L2 app chain that's nuanced and deep, <@U05BMHJMRNK> got them all -;please do share!

Ran into Barter team walking to Titan event. The BD/Ops lead did most of the talking, said he was excited about Shea’s talk yesterday. He wants his technical team (the other two guys with him) to learn more about TEEs for both understanding how the operate to evaluate engaging with them and for how they can help their own stack. He said it’s becoming harder and harder to be a solver these days. Big FB fan, wants to build on Suave.

quick ethcc notes:
• bananagun said they were open to sending flow to us, really liked Shea's talk. they're distracted because of Solana right now. Said that 2-3 months they'd return to their OF on EVM chains.
• Blocknative wants to spin out their wallet related stuff - they're looking for maintainers for their wallet tooling (<@U05DY4WTLUB> OKX really liked this, right?) and for a home for their RPC flow. I told him we'd be interested.
• A lot of random little things with Kevin from SCP, seems they got nerdsniped by Solana too and are considering investing in trading there. He also revealed they were adversarially faking bids at some point (he thought maybe even right now) to get Titan to send them bananagun flow (because Titan thinks they won't win the block).

oh one more, Max from ConsenSys said they liked the refund builder and were excited about it. Max prefers that to the auction they run. Max went so far as to say he'd even advocate for MetaMask to send all their flow to it and just use it once it got big, but that would take "quarters not days."

He also pointed out if we're going to be subsidizing we should just pay for MetaMask flow instead, because that has the dual effect of improving our blocks and taking value from someone else. I didn't quite get this on first pass, but he was quite confident we could get 2x the bang for our buck this way.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 09/07/2024 20:13:21 Z:
|   I think he means that if you win the auction you get the flow exclusively so someone else can’t use it to bid against you.

This 2x seems to check out if I’m right about that exclusivity being part of the design.
|   How did he hear about the refund builder? Interested what channels have been most effective for us

|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 09/07/2024 20:13:58 Z:
|   The downside of bidding for flow instead of upping block bids is that you're easily griefed

|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 09/07/2024 20:17:44 Z:
|   Someone outbids you at the block level because you arent bidding much since most of your "value" went to MM
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 09/07/2024 21:12:43 Z:
|   It would seem like you still get added value from the MM flow that will make your bid higher :thinking_face: 
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 09/07/2024 21:13:05 Z:
|   Depends how much you bid ofc
|   Think of it like this: 
• OF in mempool is worth 5
• MM flow worth 10
• You bid 9 for MM flow and win
• Now your block is worth 6=5+1 (not 15) and others have a bid of 5

|   I agree that buying metamask flow would get us more than subsidizing. <@U03GRQX5HGR> has some reservations about doing it, but IMO we have no choice. Every builder knows that buying Cowswap + MM flow is tablestakes if you want to compete
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 10/07/2024 06:26:50 Z:

|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 10/07/2024 06:28:01 Z:
|   <@U03FP0H62HH> I think you have a deep misunderstanding about me and my decision making framework :)
In general, I am against rushing into subsidies without sustainability, and against under the table deals that unnecessarily put us in a weaker position. I also would prefer not rushing into playing in a zero sum game where we don't have an edge, nor a game once we are in, and that we irreversibly lose what is more valuable to us and have low odds making it.

Metamask auction mechanism is awfully centralizing, small builders not only do not win, they lose money playing. While we are still in strategizing stage, not move is the best move. The earlier (when we are not ready) we enter the more money we lose in metamask auction, plus we lose all optionality in speaking freely about Metamask. Our current NDA with Consensys ends Aug 29, and I am taking all of these factors into account.

That said, thanks to our amazing team on the ground at ETHcc (when you get here you can feel it yourself!) and amazing communications by <@U03PZSSETQA>  - our builder refund mechanism is well received, the nature of it's sealed bid second price auction is somewhat more palatable than status quo. 

If we succeed in achieving a schelling point for our TEE Builder, then we have a lot more space to design around, how we turn orderflow acquisition into a fun unifying moment with the community. Better off, we may reestablish our legitimacy in the game if we win this narrative battle, to influence Metamask to modify their auction design for the better. We are not there yet, each day we are still monitoring the community sentiment on the ground, and proactively manage expectations.
|   
|   > Robert [U02CJ9QVAL9] @ 10/07/2024 06:32:14 Z:
|   I think we’re all mostly aligned there <@U03GRQX5HGR>. The point Max was making is that if we are going to subsidize you get more leverage by doing it via MM flow rather than outright value to the block, which sort of makes sense to me.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 10/07/2024 06:36:00 Z:
|   from the metamask auction mechanism pov, max is right about the subsidy math - makes more sense, however, how much flow we will actually get, keep in mind this is an optionality one way street. 
I would appreciate we run the numbers (how much can they get us to with their flow) before we sign any consensys nda so we have a reasonable expectation. also all deals will go out, a deal with Metamask like this, will likely lose us some more.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 10/07/2024 06:37:16 Z:
|   "While we are still in strategizing stage, not move is the best move."

We are subsidizing around $3k/day right now (see <https://relayscan.io/builder-profit?t=24h>), so we are not exactly still in strategizing stage. That money is also lost forever.

Where I agree is that signing a choking NDA with Metamask to access that auction might be a one-way door (at least temporarily) and hence more inflexible than subsidzing ourselves
|   So def +1 not rushing into Metamask NDA. My statement was more about mid term
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 10/07/2024 06:38:30 Z:
|   my understanding if the current subsidy decision: it's a time bound experiment, not a strategy deployed. 
this was what I was told, and I view it as such.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 10/07/2024 06:39:13 Z:
|   Btw its def good helpful data point that for $3k spent/day, we might have twice the bang for buck with Metamask. Makes the two options easier to compare
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 10/07/2024 06:43:53 Z:
|   From Subsidy to directly acquire different sort of OF, and partnership strategy with key accounts, all of this is part of a very dynamic GTM strategy. I explicitly shared my opinion that the real decision needs to be made AFTER ethcc, when we have more information on hand about reception of the release, and that we have decent idea on who can commit OF under what condition, and how much free flow we can stack up for how long, how much leverage we can have, what's a coherent ecosystem aware narrative, this way we can have a concrete plan to get to our target (we need to align on this after ethcc as well...)
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 10/07/2024 06:46:19 Z:
|   we should definitely put a date on discussing our GTM plan post ethcc. (cc.  <@U06R23USPL7> )
we can already start doing some analysis on Metamask OF value, and how much flow they have and how much does it impact our landing rate holding all else constant... (cc. <@U06TUB9EW2Y> <@U03N9H4JP8C>)

<https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlo-fodor-59841519/|Laszlo Fodor> - founder
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubenbrons/|Ruben Brons> - bd and investment lead

Long time hft market maker (founded 2004), they are global and have been in crypto for awhile.  Their hft systems integrate with L2s fairly easily and thatʻs where they do most of their trading vs CEX.  They do L1 trades but not their specialty.

• TEE builder - they have their own builder with features built on Geth builder version but they donʻt want to run a builder or find order flow. They are willing to send CEX-DEX private flow to us (no multiplexing to competitors). Very active on L2 since their L2 sequencer set-up is similar to hft and integrates with their systems well. They build in Rust since its the only scalable language.
• TEE stack - willing to work with solvers and other tradfi based projects that maybe donʻt have the tradfi experience on design and integration. They can also market make and invest in TEE stack SUAPPs so overall they are willing to help build out the TEE protocol and SUAPPs.
• L2 Research - They have a dedicated research team and run their own nodes (Base, Arbitrum, OP). I told them about the State of L2 MEV and L2 research and they are down to collaborate and help with research.

I met up with Ben from Coinbase at EthCC to talk about how things are going with onboarding their wallet/exchange to Protect. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Shea-Ben-EthCC-catch-up-befd826d4681446186f9fc43ece5b781>

Highlights
• Ben reiterated that they spend a lot of gas; even if they could save just 5% it would make a real difference.
• The custody team is actively looking to cut costs right now and may be another good target beyond wallet and retail (ie exchange)
• I poked about if the wallet team is planning to incorporate a private RPC. It seems like ben is a bit out of the loop on this, he’s been OOO, but has a 1:1 with the new wallet lead next week and promised to check and let us know what the status is. I emphasized that we’d want the chance to make our case and ensure they have the full picture when comparing OFAs if it comes to that. Ben says that generally the wallet team is small and has been very busy with both on chain summer and trying to support solana. He’s wrapping up their proposal which will be sent to the exchange and wallet teams.
• Ben independently brought up the topic of TEEs. He senses that they’re going to be a big deal and doesn’t want coinbase to be unprepared. To start with he’s producing a strategy doc and asked for us to share some educational resources. I suggested that the most immediate actionable thing could be to participate in a permissioned version of TEE builder network and he was on board.

|   What does 'permissioned version' mean for the tee builder?
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 11/07/2024 09:54:30 Z:
|   We run a network of TEE builder nodes but the operators are whitelisted, not fully permissionless. A middle step
Talked with Bryan (CEO @ layer zero) about sending their traffic to Protect for gas and MEV refunds. It seems like they’re quite open to it and we have concrete next steps to share specs/docs and figure out what the integration will look like. This would be exciting if we can handle the load because layerzero has a lot of orderflow. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Shea-Bryan-EthCC-chat-9026ab5f1b8646baaafaacfa986cfa88>

Highlights
• Layer zero sends a ton of transactions and uses a ton of gas. So far they’ve been focused on growth but if there’s a simple way to cut costs it’s a no brainer for them to use.
• Today there’s no MEV, just a lot of gas fees. But soon they’re also introducing a feature which will let users bridge + swap in the same transaction. This would likely generate MEV so MEV refunds will become relevant as well.
• We talked about what requirements they might have for an RPC. The main issue is their load and making sure transactions aren’t delayed. Specifically V1 transactions, which make up ~40% of their flow today, are nonce order enforced meaning that they have to land in a specific order. If one gets stuck, every transaction gets delayed. In V2 this is not a problem and they expect more flow to migrate here over time, but we do need to keep this in mind for V1.
• As next steps I’ll share our docs and they’re going to give us info on exact uptime / performance / etc requirements that they have. They don’t need official SLAs; if anything the real issue will just be on our end making sure our infra doesn’t fall over with the amount of txs they have. Bryan noted that they’ve had experience with their load causing problems for other providers before (eg with vercel) so we should just go in with our eyes open. (Rohan leads their eng team and will be our main contact; alvin is an engineer who’s been working on gas stuff and I chatted with previously).
• Looking ahead, the parties that submit layer zero transactions are called executors. Layer zero themselves run an executor that handles the majority of traffic but anyone can choose or run their own. They’re responsible for quoting gas and actually posting the txs. Bryan noted two teams that use their own executors today: tapioka and holograph. If the integration goes well for the main layer zero executor then expanding into other executors could be an interesting next step for us.

I talked with EG of the Infura team, who used to lead Infura and now is leading their Decentralized Infrastructure Network (“DIN”). h/t: <@U0746NXHEEA> for setting it up!

The DIN is their vision for how to decentralize. More practically as a business, they need to be able to serve requests for other networks and they can’t support all of them. And this was causing them to lose some business more, so it makes sense. They’re using MetaMask flow to bootstrap this which is why other people join.

We talked about Flashbots running a node. They’re open minded to that. I pitched them on them running a TEE Builder node too, and they’re open minded to that. They were fascinated by TEEs and immediately saw how it could help them decentralize because it’s actually similar to the problems we have in decentralizing!

We talked about potential integrations. They’re open minded. Alchemy and quicknode offer private transaction APIs, and we get traction from those. But it might not make sense for them depending on their user base. In particular, their users might go direct to us. But they were excited about that.

Finally, we talked about our RPC. It turns out they had the same scaling problems we have. They suggested to solve the problem of people using our rpc in an abusive way we need some kind of authentication. That made sense to me.

• Ray is on the defi desk. Defi desk has 6 devs, 4 traders. 60 people total for crypto split into prime-brokerage and prop trading. The dev team is learning rust with 1 solid rust dev and the rest of the team picking it up. Ray has been coding rust for 6 months.
• The desk is active on l1 but their focus now is l2. They are on OP, Arbitrum, with Base and Blast going live soon. Polygon, BSC, Aptos, and Solana.
• They donʻt cover as many pools as SCP and Wintermute which means they have less CEX-DEX opportunities and less order flow. Felix asked what our timeline was for tee builder to gain the necessary order flow to reach the tipping point to win blocks consistently.
• FT separate builders into two tiers - competitive (SCP, Rsync) and neutral (Titan, FB) and mainly send to Titan. They are willing to send us test order flow.
• Ray would like to contribute to the tee builder improvements and will advocate for it in Flow Traders. He likes the idea of a Builder Olympics since competition and pr is always good.

Tokka - Wee Howe 1:1

• Order flow: <@U03G59ZN90D> <@U05578MHMUZ> 
    ◦ Feels order flow can be addressed from 2 areas - 1) wallets and 2) dapps and that dapps are their main focus for capturing mev. It would be nice if <http://orderflow.art|orderflow.art> could be updated regularly.
• Analytics: <@U03N9H4JP8C> <@U05578MHMUZ>
    ◦ Looking for insight about order flow game. <http://Orderflow.art|Orderflow.art> needs to be updated on a more frequent basis.  
    ◦ It would be great for a curated list of FB data sources in github.
• Builder: <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U064F77UBHN> 
    ◦ Cancellations are really important for their strategies like the other market makers. They would like to have the same order notifications that tradfi exchanges give.
        ▪︎ Cancels: 1) acknowledgement of cancel request for bundle, 2) confirmation of bundle cancel.
    ◦ Timing: they would like to submit cancels as close to block submission time as possible but maybe thereʻs a cutoff time that we can create.
    ◦ Doesnʻt feel that they would contribute openly to tee builder. The better route would be a mm consortium setting a uniform set of builder features for market makers that can be integrated into every builder.

• Cartesi is a public good funded by the Cartesi Foundation which has roughly $20mm in its treasury. CTSI is used mainly for governance with no value accretion built into its ecosystem so far.  Thereʻs 20 devs in Brazil and more globally.  
• Apps are gaming and social fi.  Felipe showed me a cool emulator gaming app that could run cartridge games on.
• Most dapps are on an L2 like Base so transactions fees are low and then settle to Ethereum.  
• Their RISC-V architecture is the main attraction for apps to use them for an appchain.  They spent a lot of time building this.

Talked to Matt Cutler from Blocknative for a bit:
• They are selling their wallet aggregation product and Transaction Boost
• They have 2k txs/day, they say it's mostly high quality swap flow from wallets like IMToken. They don't know how much is exclusive or not.
• He's not as interested in selling the flow for dollars in some corporate transaction, but instead wants to find some kind of strategic partnership
• e.g. he is interested in launching a TEE product that gets information out of private mempools to help wallets and rollups price their transcations, and if we could partner with him on that it'd make it much more appealing
• he was interested in being able to say "Flashbots looked at my thing and thinks it is secure" and that was appealing to him, as was using our tooling.
• His timeline is to figure out a deal end of month, and execute it by the end of August.
• He expects people to bid for their tx flow, he was saying maybe low 6 figs, high 6 figs

Notes from talk with Kubi from Titan Builder:

_Bananagun_
• They are productizing their OF deal with Bananagun, it takes transactions as an input with some parameters like "how many blocks are you willing to wait" and tries to get you best execution
    ◦ They put a lot of work into how to tell when they'll win the block - they get around bid faking by looking at what "market condition" they are in, so if they see a super huge SCP bid in a market doesn't make sense for that, they ignore the fake SCP bid
• They talked with SCP about an orderflow sharing agreement, it broke down because SCP refused to share their orderflow with Titan even if Titan shared bananagun
• According to Titan they were able to give Bananagun a better product experience than beaverbuild, which is why Banana went with them - SCP did not handle bananagun's flow well when they had it, so bananagun went back to Titan.
_Bloxroute_
• Bloxroute is launching a "relay security" product where proposers register "I want x% of value from this block" and only blocks that meet that criteria, e.g. Titan blocks would be limited from taking profit
    ◦ Kubi thinks it falls apart if you are sophisticated
• Bloxroute is also going to launch an OF product, it's the same as Titan's where yous end flow and they monetize it for you. But! They're going to user builder's blocks at their relay as an input to try to compete :exploding_head: 
• Kubi was super upset to hear that bloxroute is leaking bundle data via their relay
_Strategic outlook for Titan_
• I asked Kubi what his plan was if he was successful with his OF product, he did not have a good answer. I followed up and asked "What will do you if you get 50%" and he didn't have a good answer.
• I found his answer to the question of “What is the endgame for these orderflow deals” to be unconvincing
• When probed he did admit they’d be uncomfortable building more than 50% in a centralized way. They have been thinking about decentralizing!
_on decentralizing_ 
• Kubi would not say much about how exactly how, but they imagine having a part of the system that is very fast for cex-dex and a part that is more slow
• Kubi said they were thinking about how to work with us
• He had a lot of questions about TEEs
• He seemed open to a deeper collaboration with us, which I left the door open to
_General_
• They're not sure how the community sees them and was looking for some insight from me

|   <@U06TUB9EW2Y> I think you overestimate their sophistication. if they currently send to the public mempool, which it sounds like, they just may not know the alternatives.
In this case, they may not know that there are private mempools they can send to that work with all the top block builders.
|   That said, the TEEbuilder basically has Flashbots Protect built in now (it also multiplexes txns and gives refunds). So we should actually understand if we should merge these products, and where mev-share will fit in

|   there are definitely quite a few things that could benefit from merging. many services essentially do the same thing, which could be confusing to users and hard to all maintain to best possible condition at the same time. examples include Protect/MEV-Share and now Pareto Builder, various libraries/API endpoints to send us bundle…

|   I will schedule a brainstorming to think about this
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 15/07/2024 13:33:28 Z:
|   Why are we pitching these separately in the first place? When we talk to customers we sell Protect. Protect gives you privacy and refunds (MEV+gas). It uses our builder to provide those things, and there are more sophisticated ways to access them (eg other APIs), but the simple pitch is send to Protect for privacy and refunds.
|   We haven’t mentioned anything about “pareto builder” publicly either
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 15/07/2024 13:58:36 Z:
|   It makes sense to sell Protect + builder as separate things, but both multiplex txns and both give refunds (although different kinds). It's complex to understand for customers even the difference between our own products, let alone others in the market. So I think we should revisit how to position them respectively

Meeting with Binance Exchange Wallet (<https://www.notion.so/Initial-Meeting-with-Binance-Exchange-Wallet-3e2769df665046d1b826628068ede3cd?pvs=4|Detailed notes>)
Attendee: <@U03PZSSETQA> and <@U05DY4WTLUB>

• Binance exchange wallet team, with 130k - 150k daily withdrawals, about 3 - 5 per second, is actively seeking gas optimization solutions. The team also manages consolidation transactions for cold wallet. Amount unclear.
• They bypassed middlemen (like Blink) to engage directly with Flashbots
• Main interest: gas refunds and fast transaction inclusion
• Currently sending transactions directly to mempool. Mostly meeting and exploring options provided by builders
• Showed interest in Pareto Builder and smart multiplexing strategies
• Key concern: balancing fast transaction inclusion with potential gas refunds
• Binance side is interested in quantitative gas fee refund estimate but it is hard for us to calculate as it depends on our marketshare.

Common prefix want to spin out an entity to get VC funding to build a CR mechanism.
• They are looking to implement the design they recommended in their report and at this point we know that it (or a simpler version) is what we need. 
• They are trying to raise and would want to raise off the idea that we would be interested in using the product (see msg below)
• I am waiting to hear back from Espresso who might also ship the necessary code (the difference being that common prefix wants to ship it and then launch an instance of it)
• They were encouraged by the eigenlayer people who have said that lots of use cases have demand for CR (we told them the same)
• My personal view is that its not clear to me that we would need their services, but we do want the code to exist and it would be nice if there was someone who was actively maintaining it and talking to various users w various use cases. If the letter doesn't cost us anything we may as well sign it off.

• can we get a gurantee on the license? Espresso is open source but we cant actually use their code without their permission and are not allowed to modify it. I guess their message does address "if its open source enough"
• if they have no experience with prod software then seems like 0 chance we use this in prod? we risk neutrality on supporting a code base for this effort i.e. creating a Justin Drake like scenario

|   From experience I think a letter of intent from us 10x'es their fund raising potential and Im not sure what we get from it.

|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 17/07/2024 22:18:51 Z:
|   Afaiu narwhal gives us reliable broadcast of the lists. This gives a guarantee that the whole committee has seen these lists (because most of them have signed each list)

This is mostly useful to remove the need for the leader/auctioneer to broadcast lists with a block/auction result (e.g if you do add this on to consensus). Not sure what else we get from it. 

What Ive been thinking (and discussing w people when I bring up this topic) is having two modes for the implementation to operate in: one with reliable broadcast and one without since without is lower overhead/latency

|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 18/07/2024 06:51:33 Z:
|   My initial thoughts:
• we need something like this to exist to augment SUAVE
• there being outside options may be good, even if we end up building our own version -- assuming doing this isn't a core capability for us
• it also helps, if we want to build/change it, to have used some existing version before.
• the outsourcing matrix is a pretty good mental model for this: if its important but not strategically relevant - then outsourcing is the right choice. if it was important but strategically relevant, we should build it in-house  (below)
tldr it really comes down to whether you think owning CR is strategically important to us. Given from how little we have talked about it before, and my own knowledge about the CR industry, it doesn't seem like that's the case.
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 18/07/2024 07:26:43 Z:
|   I would push back on the statement we have talked about this very little
• Quintus and I have been discussing this since I joined and at one point it was probably 1/3 of my time (<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Suave-Censorship-Resistance-f4d2ad9576264ab58c6df69f378bb913?pvs=4|https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Suave-Censorship-Resistance-f4d2ad9576264ab58c6df69f378bb913?pvs=4> and <https://hackmd.io/BALXiGhqRFmYqsJICpDhYg|https://hackmd.io/BALXiGhqRFmYqsJICpDhYg>)
• We gave common prefix a $20k grant which isn’t huge in the scheme of grants but is the largest we’ve approved on SUAVE side (although our accounting considers nethermind contracting as a grant which I think doesn’t make sense) 
• Additionally, CR is the only requirement of the unichain that we cannot satisfy. Dan Robinson has even said directly that he doesn’t care about TEEs as anything other than a means to an end to get CR.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 18/07/2024 07:29:25 Z:
|   Where do you see us in the matrix?
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 18/07/2024 07:47:08 Z:
|   I don’t fully understand what “operational performance” is in our context and above your saying that is equivalent to being important with “important and strategically relevant”. I do think it’s both important and strategically relevant, and if it was something that performed poorly it would affect the operation of SUAVE. A counterfactual hypothetical would be who would uniswap chose if we didn’t have the ability to offer CR but Sorella did. In a world where Common Prefix builds this for us though then I guess the counter factual is more like who would uniswap choose, sorella with an in house CR or us with an OS CR which is a bit of a leap of faith that we can use since these guys are raising VC money for this and we have no guarantee it’s an OS license we want. One more hypothetical is that I think it’s fine if someone else builds it but I think we need to own the narrative of it, something more like a spec we initiated and others built. Unfortunately owning the narrative is worth 90% of the value to the user, a conclusion that we can draw from our chat with conduit at EthCC where they said some rollups want Espresso and they don’t even know why, they just heard about shared sequencing and asked for it. I don’t think it would be crazy if CR becomes a toggle on a RaaS one day.

Got lunch with Barnabe and a two interesting notes:
• Quite bullish on FOCIL and the idea of block production via multiple inclusion lists
    ◦ Role of the builder is a question here, there are designs where builders are very minimal
    ◦ Kartik Nayak thinks this actually ends up looking like a DAG of mini-blocks, almost identical to our line of thinking about using Narwhal for the mempool and same questions that came up
• RIG, and potentially wider EF, is getting less bullish on the overhead of enabling external research and considering moving towards less but more high quality collaborations. 
    ◦ I think we should probably follow something like this for enabling research PoCs on SUAVE
    ◦ Will be a main topic of their offsite next week in Japan
    ◦ Mentioned external research overhead as a potential reason why other chains like Solana are winning
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/07/2024 13:00:06 Z:
|   I'm getting the impression that these all approach similar design as they all address short term CR
• multiple concurrent proposer
• FOCIL
• dag with miniblocks
• common prefix design for bulletin chain
am I missing something here? please enlighten me...
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 18/07/2024 13:13:33 Z:
|   ABCI++ with vote extentions but yes, you're correct, they're all approaching the same thing. Which is a good sign that a research direction is promising!
|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 18/07/2024 13:29:13 Z:
|   There are basically 3 types of CR mechanisms:
• MCP -> the attester set combines “miniblocks”
• ILs/common prefix/multiplicity (abci vote extensions)-> the leader is responsible for combining and broadcasting “miniblocks”
• Narwhal/what celestia was thinking about -> the lists are reliably broadcast before the leader gets them so the leader doesnt need to propagate, only to choose how they’re combined. 
The first is not well researched and needs bery deep eth protocol changes
For block building the second kind makes the most sense if we are going to use an external IL committee since the reliable broadcast approach would introduce latency without substantial benefits afaict

I just had a chat with David Sneider from <https://developer.litprotocol.com/|Lit Protocol> - they're a TEE + "MPC" key management system
• what this means in practice is that key shares are distributed between a bunch of people running AMD SEV and there are some rules for when a signature should be made (which are enforced by the TEE)
•  web3 focused, team of 20, launching token soon
• trying to be a platform on top of which people can build chain/account abstraction solutions. For example <https://www.tradegenius.com/|genius> is a chain agnostic DEX built on lit (I havent looked into it too deeply)
• He seemed to be quite informed and was trying to find technical problems that overlap
    ◦ They query blockchain RPCs from within enclaves
    ◦ They have looked at ORAM but not implemented
    ◦ Have just got reproducible builds working for SEV
    ◦ Was interested in collab'ing on governance schemes for "report rotation" (i.e. changing MRTD/ENCLAVE)
    ◦ Maybe we can learn from them in terms of how they are handling rotation of the MPC set
• View their largest competitors as NEAR and Particle (and one other one I forgot)

We had a chat with Nathan at EthCC and building his app Euphoria on SUAVE:
• Pivoted from a Perp Dex to a Shitcoin Prediction Market, although they're technically the same under the hood
• Want to allow uses to "draw" their prediction/perp curve onto the app and have a 2-click experience
• They're roughly targeting an MVP app in the next 6 months
I believe ball is in our court to follow up on this but curious to get thoughts from <@U03FP0H62HH> and <@U02CJ9QVAL9> and ideal outcome here. I do agree it would be awesome having them as core devs on the platform.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 19/07/2024 16:39:21 Z:
|   In coordination w/ Robert, I tried to feel out if he's interested in abandoning the idea and just join Flashbots instead to work with us on making the L1 builder succeed, as well platformizing and decentralizing it.

While he hasn't signed a term sheet yet, he feels very passionate about his startup idea, and doubled down on building on SUAVE as well as contributing significant time to improving the platform. He is also open to becoming a formal advisor, if we want that. The plan is to follow up once <@U02CJ9QVAL9> is back

So to answer your OG question, imo the ideal outcome was for him to abandon the idea (I'm not a big believer) and join FB. The second most ideal outcome is he builds on SUAVE and succeeds massively, while contributing significantly to the underlying platform. The third most ideal is he builds on SUAVE, his project doesn't go super well, but he still contributes back a lot, and maybe we poach him when it's not going so well.

IMO the third best scenario is also by far the most likely.

Went to Phylax Offsite earlier this week:
• They're working on hack prevention software (founder is ex-nomad bridge founding eng)
• They effectively allow dapps to define invariants on execution of their smart contracts and rely on block builders to uphold this, dont think it's possible to enforce on L1 so focused on L2 
• They have interest from Base and are working on a PoC for them
• I redid their entire architecture and convinced them to be a module ontop of the rbuilder, they're going to build a very hacky private version bc they think the space is hyper competitive but want to OS it and build in the open with us by DevCon

Chatted with Marko the Cosmos SDK PM:
• They spent a while rewriting to allow for more modular consensus and storage in the SDK
• "IBC Light" is going live soon which removes the requirement for chains to have a communication heavy channel between each other
• Main focus for SDK is enabling rollups

For orderflow perspective, might be interesting to talk to Coinbase Institutional Custody guy, who I assume would be there as well. What we are trying to sell to exchange hot wallet might be interesting to them as well

|   From what I heard, most etf providers will use a broker like galaxy or coinbase for their trading flows. If you're in new york, galaxy is a good call to make. They have an asset management arm too.

Had a meeting with Conduit (Forrest + Emiliano + Andrew chime in)
• they feel we’re 2-3 weeks of work away from being ready to co-market (this is also my take since we don’t need to be prod ready to ship the co-market.
• Got a list of their concerns which are mainly sync speed and auth
• they also asked questions around running this themselves + what this looks like when it’s in TEEs. I had a few answers but we do need a more satisfactory vision here
• Forrest will do a pipeline audit and come up with 3 - 5 high likelihood candidates that would be a good fit to pilot with. The immediate one that came to mind though is <http://concrete.xyz|concrete.xyz> which is an up&coming defi L2 chain. 
• We both agreed that the short to medium term target of handling 2 - 3 rollups well is the bar to getting added as “self-serve” in the UI (self serve has some meaty eng challenges as well on our side which I didn’t bring up)

Had a chat with Drew from Commit-Boost
• his world view on preconfs, proposer commitments, and the builder market are: 1) number of commitment types proposers can make is more likely to be greater than it is today 2) different commitment types lower barriers to entry for new block builder categories i.e. solvers are more likely to build a certain part of the block and specialize in that
• 6 month path is PBS module and preconf network is live by end of year, commitments on top of that are likely to be inclusion list experiments and sigma prime is working on a cool module.
• His ask for Flashbots: 1) be open to engaging with commit boost and specifically be more vocal about push back so designs can improve 2) pay attention to projects building commitment sidecars which have plans to verticalize and not OS
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 22/07/2024 22:02:02 Z:
|   I sent these points back to him and replied :“The point of commit-boost is to mostly mitigate the risk of a bunch of side cars and the implications that has on ethereum while also leaving for open innovation downstream. Also, doing this as a public good with no plans for monetization / not for profit / grant backed effort is key like you say in the last point. 

Re inclusion lists, I think there are a few teams working on some IL modules, but this is the one I am closest with.

If we give proposers back some autonomy around how their block is constructed, I think ethereum is better for it (hence why I think the number of commitments will and should grow). Today's market proposers just have to trust 4 relays + 3 builders and can't really put any constraints around how they construct the block. Ideally we put the trust back into the proposer who can force downstream parties to build according to the constraints they want.”

BlockDaemon <> Sepior MPC wallet - Frank Wiener

<https://www.blockdaemon.com/blog/blockdaemon-acquires-leading-data-digital-asset-security-firm-sepior|Blockdaemon acquired Sepior> and offers WaaS and Infra-aaS to larger institutions (100+ customers). Their current WaaS allows customers to integrate a web3 wallet directly into their mobile app. They offer customers passkey solutions via Google / AWS and other cloud services and could potentially offer a FB TDX solution as an option in the future.

They offer 3 WaaS solutions:
1. Full turnkey wallet license
2. Wallet SDK
3. Core key MPC management tech via APIs.
Sepior team:
• marketing team - 8 people
• product managers - 3 or 4
Block Daemon headcount > 200

Best way for potential MEV-Protect integration:
1. BlockDaemon would socialize the concept of MEV protection with their clients and if there is enough interest, they will integrate it with their MPC offering.
2. FB provide MEV Protect 1-pager and docs.

LibEVM, Minimoon, <@U06TUB9EW2Y> <@U03GRQX5HGR>

• Libevm updates:
    ◦ They are focussed on CEX-DEX arbitrage currently. Trading roughly 1mm a day on mainnet only. They believe that they can scale this linearly if not exponentially. The have found edge in trading major pairs since others are not searching through multiple paths.
• Order flow: <@U03N9H4JP8C> <@U05578MHMUZ> 
    ◦ Penguin does not have relationships with searchers. They are using onchain data and heuristics for all of their analysis.
    ◦ Lib reiterated what Joe said saying that without Banana Gun and CEX-DEX flow, itʻs impossible to win blocks. Combining all the searchers including Jared would not be enough to win the block.
    ◦ Minimoon says that Beaver winning Jared blocks is probably mainly because they land a majority of blocks rather than an XOF deal.
    ◦ Blink / ChainBound / Merkle were all started hoping to be acquired by Consensus since Consensus was looking for a MEV arm. As far as using them for OF, heʻs never used any of them since he didnʻt think they were generating unique data. He recommended checking mempool dumpster for Blink / Chainbound, Merkle, and Block Expert to confirm.
    ◦ Lib mentioned that with the builder69 API, OFAs can add a refund % or refund recipient to the bundle. So many OFAs (Merkle, Blink, MEV Blocker) obtain order flow from somewhere else and repackage it into a bundle before sending it to builders. He didnʻt research where the OFAs are finding the order flow.
• TEE Builder collaboration <@U03PZSSETQA> 
    ◦ Reiterates that he is happy to send CEX-DEX flow to TEE / r builder but the relay needs to be more competitive. Lib notes that Banana Gun flow and / or SCP CEX-DEX flow is needed to win blocks.
    ◦ Specific changes that would improve the relay would be a websocket to receive the top bid from the FB relay. This would loosen the relay rate limit requirements and prevent spamming. Ultrasound also provides a websocket that sends the top new bid update.
    ◦ Another low-hanging fruit for builder improvement is a second co-location site for r builder.
    ◦ Noted that competitive building improvements can be open-sourced but reputational order flow (i.e. staking requirements for order flow) is harder.
• Consulting arrangement <@U04MQRHLBPY> <@U06R23USPL7> 
    ◦ Interested in consulting opportunities to improve r builder competitiveness and order flow research. Willing to offer 10 hours a week but need to see a scope before determining pricing.
    ◦ Tinaʻs consulting goals are to understand market dynamics and the order flow buying space. Tina requests that an NDA be in place since the order flow analysis could contain sensitive information.
• State of MEV proposal
    ◦ Tina needs to chase down Ken and Uniswap Foundation for grant confirmation.
    ◦ Tesa will send Lib and MiniMoon a proposal example and the RFP. Lib will submit a proposal for their work on the dashboards at <http://Libmev.com|Libmev.com>.

They know our builder submits to other relays right?

They’ve asked us for those features <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Libevm-block-building-call-6407298d28b048308ca696ba7d416102|before> so not surprising

Blocknative:
• They have integrations with IMToken and MathWallet
    ◦ I asked them for all the names as well as a time period of unique transaction hashes for us to analyze
• Matt got TEE-pilled in Brussels but has since then soured on making it a priority
• They are primarily interested in making a deal with someone who can provide strategic value to them moreso than maximizing $ for their OF
• They are strategically focused on everything gas related. They want to help gas producers and consumers figure out gas and create products around that.
• We talked about a few ways we could strategically partner
    ◦ We could co-sell, acting as a distribution channel for them - as we talk to a lot of their target customers and we have been asked before about whether we'd offer products that they offer --> *this is what piqued his interest the most*
    ◦ They would be interested in the TEE party incentivized orderflow as a part of this --> this was also of keen interest
    ◦ Blocknative would be interested in being a node for the TEE builder when we go multi-operator, but their interest is inversely proportional to the number of nodes (they don't want to be 1 of 30 people involved, they would want to be 1 of 3)
• They are on a timeline of "weeks not months"
I think it's not hard for us to close them if we want, could be a nice way to add a boost to our OF

Caught up with Luke Youngblood (ex Coinbase Cloud OG, early FB contributor) from <http://Moonwell.fi|Moonwell.fi> - a open lending platform on Base, Moonbeam and Moonriver, he is one of the rare talents that has deep experience in distributed systems and infra, as well as solidity and application space.
• Moonwell is a launch partner of Base, next step he may be shipping some features that can achieve better guarantees with sequencing, he thinks TEE sequencers with private mempools may be a great opportunity
• He is advising *<http://b3.fun|b3.fun> - a Base L3 founded by ex-Coinbase Cloud gaming lead,* which has strike deals with many major gaming companies, including launching a Pokemon like real world geo-location AR game very soon. They have potentially scaling and spamming and MEV problems, he can intro to us.
• He believes a lot of the AA stuff posits a great opportunity if we focus on security / attestation for secure enclaves.
He will be at Base camp - I told him he should meet up with you <@U02CJ9QVAL9> . He may have some time later this fall to contribute to some systems architecture stuff. <@U06R23USPL7>

*Babylon - Bitcoin MEV / MEV & Information Theory*
Had a nice chat with <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tse|David Tse> - founder of Babylon, who's working out of the Duck in NYC this and next week. Ever since the Stanford research workshop 2 years ago, I have wanted to follow up with him on information theory and solving our privacy efficiency frontier. We identified immediately a few areas we can dive deeper while he is in NYC:
1. David Tse is interested in MEV (he hasn't thought much about it since our workshop 2 years ago) - and the need to address it is pressing for Babylon.
    a. Babylon is launching its main net in a few weeks.
    b. They have a cap on the Bitcoin staked, many want allocation but they want a fair launch.
    c. Bitcoin miners will do shinanagans to MEV their genesis block, and some already told them they will do so directly...
    d. They want to  make sure they have done enough on MEV mitigations, and also curious what will happen on that block...
2. He is happy to do workshop and deep dive into MEV with us, and follow up on the SUAVE Information Theory open questions we had wrt programmable privacy.

Chatted with the cto of metlife asia insurance. She’s a blockchain fan but thinks web2 companies will all have their own private chain or select different ecosystems which would negate some of the ledger recording benefits that she sees. Her big take was that blockchain would eliminate fraud activity like 1MDBʻs case. She didnʻt like bridging and the main issue between cross-chain state copying was privacy.  I said you could copy ledger states within a secure environment like a TEE and validate that the information was copied securely without decrypting the info.  She agreed that would be a good option.

Is there any project that has done cross-chain state copying as an example poc?

:zap::carousel_horse: *L2GTM: SUAVE <> Unichain Update (Non-Technical)*
`Flashbots L2 team had our 3rd formal partnership meeting since we first kindled the Unichain Collab convo in June.  The meeting primarily focused on the technical design and implementation based on the written proposal Flashbots shared. Afterwards, I had an additional informal partnership and co-marketing convo with Hayden, MC, Mark Toda and Eric Zhang.`

*Tl;Dr: Uniswap Labs has verbally committed to Flashbots as the Unichain block building launch partner, we can sequence UniChain mainnet THIS YEAR if we are technically ready, Uniswap indicated intention to pay Flashbots for our sequencing service upon SLA.*

• Uniswap Key Product Timeline:
    ◦ Sep: UniChain whitepaper
    ◦ Oct: Uni V4 launch
    ◦ Nov: UniChain mainnet launch
    ◦ Nov: DevCon joint talk + sexy demo with Flashbots
• Flashbots TEE blockbuilder will run first on the UniChain experimental testnet. 
• If all technical requirements are met, Flashbots TEE blockbuilder can expect to be upstreamed to Unichain mainnet this year, as a _paid_ service.
• We expect a draft of MOU from Uniswap Labs in ~1 week time, and expect signing in August. The MOU will spell out the expectation based on technical spec we co-designed. High level MOU direction (subject to change based on Uniswap legal and ops team reviewing the technical spec.)
    ◦ Experimental testnet: Flashbots unpaid + no SLA.
    ◦ Live on Mainnet: Flashbots get paid + subject to SLA.
    ◦ Notes:
        ▪︎ To streamline negotiation, we likely will decouple the MOU for testnet stage and mainnet stage.
        ▪︎ MOU signing is not a blocker for technical integration moving forward in the testing stage.
• We are starting to plan co-marketing:
    ◦ Joint talk/demo: Hayden + Phil at DevCon MEV day.
    ◦ Creative demo design ideas:
        ▪︎ we will brainstorm with _Crypto the Game_ - Uniswap recently acquired (now part of Uniswap marketing)
        ▪︎ potentially a demo integrated in Uniswap wallet
        ▪︎ potentially lean into geographical decentralization (90% or more of Uniswap users outside of the US)
NEXT STEPS
• <@U05BMHJMRNK> to finalize technical spec, and coordinate two team engineering sync starting next week.
• <@U03GRQX5HGR> to follow up with MC on MOU draft by EOW next week.
• <@U03GRQX5HGR> to schedule co-marketing brainstorming with Lindsay (head of marketing) and Crypto the Game team (recently acquired by Uniswap) by EOW next week. 
• <@U03GRQX5HGR> to schedule a NYC dinner between Flashbots and Hayden + MC when <@U06R23USPL7> <@U03FP0H62HH> both in town, tentative next Saturday. 
• <@U03GRQX5HGR> to invite Uniswap relevant team members to TEE Roast during SBC week.
_Note: for technical updates, please wait for <@U05BMHJMRNK> notes._

Semantic Layer - Dex Chan, Daniel Tong

Dex and Daniel are developing apps for Semantic Layer, a transaction layer. They have apps for Base, Mainnet, and SUAVE.
• IQ50 Club
    ◦ AI integration with Rachel (?)
• Degen options
    ◦ Built on Uniswap v4 hooks
    ◦ Incentivize user trading through options
They are looking to dark DEX on SUAVE and have questions about how TEEs work.  They will be at SBC and have an event on the 8th.

<@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03G0PNEV0E> <@U055KQHH3FZ> what happens when a contract in a TEE is hacked or has a bug?  do you receive the return data if you call a function?
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 02/08/2024 14:20:10 Z:
|   I find this team isnt super serious tbh. They committed to a blob SUAPP and then bailed. To answer ur question, if its a smart contract hack its no different than a contract on a not TEE i.e. yes ur private data can be leaked if ur invariant is exploited

I talked with Guillaume, a VP from ledger, about integrating Protect. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Ledger-Live-Protect-intro-call-e0027bc8263641fe839b3be873c7618f>

Highlights:
• Ledger is well informed about MEV protection and is actively preparing to run trials with Merkle and Blink in September. They didn’t consider Flashbots because they had an impression that we aren’t private because we “use bots in the public mempool to generate revenue”. (I corrected this).
• They care about (1) uptime (2) inclusion speed (3) revenue.
• Guillaume wanted to know why we are differentiated from other solutions, especially on privacy and the nature of our deals with builders. I emphasized our work on DOWG and TEEs, and explained how our products get users included faster on chain (vs PFOF deals where priority fees are discounted in advance and fewer builders participate).
• I emphasized our work on decentralization, privacy, and security. This resonated a lot with Guillaume. They have misgivings about PFOF deals because they feel they are centralizing. We talked about how Flashbots and Ledger have shared values/brand — “maybe we should use Flashbots instead for the brand”!
• As next steps we agreed that they would include us in the trial they plan to run in September. Let’s be ready to provide them white glove support when that happens cc <@U05DY4WTLUB>. I asked Guillaume to give us a heads up so we can make sure they’re using the right settings etc. I don’t expect we’ll win on revenue but we should try to hit it out of the park on performance, support, and branding.

I’m curious if we could get p2p to run a node in our TEE builder network. But I don’t have a ton of priors on them. What’s our impression of their value as a partner?
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 02/08/2024 19:21:20 Z:
|   interesting!
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 02/08/2024 19:29:26 Z:
|   they are top operators, and <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03TG3UMZFD> are very familiar with them. however, may I ask the why behind looking into multiple diverse operators (you mentioned Coinbase, Google, and P2P is the 3rd one) at this stage, when having multiple top builders running them is imo the best strategy, deviation from it would entail quite a lot more work on orderflow front? Is this for EOY or next year? Love to get the context there!
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 02/08/2024 21:10:08 Z:
|   i would be interested in talking to them to collaborate on the infra side.

imo all solvers and searchers will eventually want to run in tdx bob boxes to both:
• route intents privately (solves cowswap/unix/1inch privacy and intent frontrunning issues, cex/dex searchers want them to route their intents more efficiently) 
• changes the atomic arb game to same block capture, any atomic arber will have to integrate in order to compete
that puts us at around 5-10 in the minimum case -- we're already working very closely with 3, one who has already given code (barter) and two (princess, steven) who will give code next week -- (there are <https://libmev.com/?presetRange=%2230D%22&mevTypeLabels=%5B%22Arbitrage%22%5D|10 competitive arb bots>, <https://dune.com/cowprotocol/solver-info|10 competitive solvers>), like 20 more boxes to be less restrictive, and 20 more to be able to say low barrier to entry

we spoke about needing to address the extra infra load in the success cases, this collab sounds like it could help with that and enable us to scale. cc <@U03GALFRWRG> <!subteam^S05940CAH62> for their thoughts too
|   
|   > Angela [U03G59ZN90D] @ 02/08/2024 21:12:34 Z:

|   > Daniel [U03G9SDPA1J] @ 02/08/2024 21:15:18 Z:
|   for the infra: planting seeds won’t hurt. we’re not even running this ourselves yet, so definitely still early days.
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 02/08/2024 21:40:31 Z:
|   <@U03GRQX5HGR> per your questions
• This is very much exploratory, getting a sense for what our options are, so don’t take it as necessarily indicative of one strategy vs another
• Why multiple builder operators — many reasons, esp decentralization and signaling value
• When — goal is to have multioperator for devcon, will be part of a larger roadmap shared next week
• There’s still a good degree of uncertainty around the feasibility, timing, and adoption of a model where other builders run colocated TDX pareto builders with their sources of orderflow so I don’t yet feel that we have a strong reason to commit to that at the exclusion of pursuing other “non-MEV” actors
• We could also do a bit of each; it’s probably hard to get anyone to run one of these things so I’m not inclined to be picky or limit our options out of the gates

|   > Artyom [U06NNH2H4A2] @ 05/08/2024 09:48:14 Z:
|   We've just started to learn how to run TEE infra. If p2p wants to become a go-to provider for TEE we'd need to teach them everything we know about TEE. Do we want to give away our expertise when we're the pioneers and can greatly benefit from it?

Even if do partner with them, at this point there are many unknowns in the TEE implementation and support from the vendors.
E.g., running TDX on bare-metal and make attestation to work properly requires a custom-built software. It will take a lot of back-and-forth with them to make it work. There is no clear befit of doing this and then paying a premium for the infra we taught them to run.

*Barry Plunkett (Skip)*

Barry reached out to me about some TEE policy questions -- he had hoped I would be at SBC. He and I met while doing some MEV policy work.

"_In app chain land, I've lately been getting a lot of questions about centralized sequencers and regulations and whether TEEs offer good regulatory cover for builders or sequencers. And honestly, I have no idea but figured you'd probably thought about this more than most."_

Its a good question, and I've started researching with Mossier but its one we will very much need to spend a lot of time on -- its not a legal or policy constrainer for any product work, it is more about how do we explain what TEEs do and how far can we stretch their properties in the regulatory arena. I'll have a chat with him in the coming weeks, mainly to gather info.
|   
|   > Reid Yager [U04QCPQ0CG5] @ 20/08/2024 13:27:40 Z:
|   Had a good chat with Barry yesterday. Two relevant items:

1. Skip is leaning into their oracle product for L2s and think they can go head to head with Chainlink for L2 market share (<https://docs.skip.build/connect/introduction|Skip Connect>). They are trying to weigh internally whether it makes sense to lean into TEEs to create a differentiator for the oracle product (over the centralized Chainlink alternatives). But they aren't sure about the time and resource commitment. What he wanted to pick my brain about what the notion of control and its relation to regulatory actions. 
2. Skip has a few routing products that could greatly benefit from TEEs from a regulatory concern but those are more likely Q2 next year, after (if) they've built expertise with TEEs for the Oracle product. 
Skip is trying to find the delta between in-house TEE expertise and utilizing something like a TEE Stack and moderate in-house knowledge to launch TEE products. They want to know how deep do they have to be in-house to build TEE products on a SUAVE TEE stack.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 20/08/2024 13:42:58 Z:
|   my2 cents:

TEEs are a great fit for many of Skip's products, but if the main goal is regulatory arbitrage, they are not a good fit quite yet. Need a TEE coprocessor with permissionless operators + permissioness access for that as a minimum requirement. I think ETA of that is more Q2+ 2025, maybe <@U05BMHJMRNK> has a better guess.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 20/08/2024 13:45:21 Z:
|   I think today, Phala or Automata should serve their needs much better than SUAVE
|   
|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 20/08/2024 13:58:24 Z:
|   yes I would certainly say Q2+ 2025 for permissionless coprocessing as were not actively developing coprocessing anymore but can benefit from a bunch of the L1 Multi-operator work. But you actually can run an SGX coprocessor on SUAVE permissionlessly, it's just a question of when will other parties run it for skip. Im unsure of the permissionless nature of Phala, but I dont think automata is far along here.

Talked with Robin, head of backend engineering at Layer Zero, about integrating Protect. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Shea-Roban-protect-integration-call-f7300631eb7745a98e0e93db74f5f0c2>

Highlights:
• Robin is not that well-versed in MEV (eg. didn’t know about MEV-Boost) but we got caught up quickly.
• He responded very positively to the gas refund product. Direct quote: “I’m convinced there are only things to gain from this”. He also thought our focus on decentralization and improving the market structure was inspiring, “the reason you are doing this feels great”.
• As expected, the rest of the conversation was very tactical, focused on how our refund product works and what it would look like for them to integrate. Robin had many questions: What type of txs they can send, what our business model is, how the product works, what chains we support, what the latency impact is (can we make txs faster?)
• Layer zero is sophisticated about RPC usage and this has two interesting consequences for us. (1) They track their own nonces and don’t expect to rely on us for getTxCount/status info. (2) Robin proactively flagged that they have a *ton* of read requests and will want to update their infra so we only get the writes. (This is good).
• They could test an integration as soon as September. They will need to make an internal change to handle (2) above before they integrate, though it should only be a few days’ work on their side.
• To help them prioritize and because we’re all curious, we want to rerun our EOA gas analysis for them. We originally flagged them as a high spender but they’ve migrated from type 1 to type 2 transactions and believe it reduced their gas cost significantly.

Skip is thinking of doing a “low latency credible price feed” product for rollups as a side-car that sequencers run
• their cosmos pricefeed sidecar product has worked well in the past, with the pitch of “integrate your own asset faster, can list hot tokens faster, you can own your native oracle.” Now considering repackage this to a sequencer oracle and sell to L2
• have explored TLS-Notary and TEEs, I told them TLS-Notary wouldn’t work because of latency
• ideally they want something where they can just put their existing price feed software binary in and offer it to L2 sequencers
• they will talk to RaaS next week and figure out demand

They said they need to go chat for a bit to figure out what kind of a business model they would want to pursue and if it would make sense to go for an open and permissive license so we are still waiting to see what happens.

I think you can tell Joey that we are interested in software of this nature, but we prefer to use an open and free tool and would be willing to support that coming into existence if CP decided to go for a more restrictive license.

I even brokered a deal with them / propellor heads. We should be very clear with what we want from them, which at this stage is a bit early for suave, directly. 
We can aim to ask for the same thing we ask of propellorhead, which is potentially sending their flow to L1 builder but their setup doesn't need it tbh (to my knowledge)?

Tristero - previous chats with them documented by Xinyuan <https://flashbots.slack.com/archives/C02CBSXSB0C/p1683052467008729|here>. Sam organised another call via our TG group.

Running <https://www.mach.exchange>, almost exclusively to get OF. Aiming mostly for CeFi and OTC. Selling it as a b2b2c solution and going to MetaMask and others to sell them on using Mach in the backend, because it can cut down their cost basis and they can continue to charge whatever fees they like on top. The issue they have here is that the margins are so fat for MM and others that a ~15 bps improvement actually doesn't mean much. Going after OTC because trades are not frequent enough in DeFi to warrant to lift of creating a dark clob.

Have been running some experiments with SGX, but "don't want to bet the farm on TEEs yet." In fact, they'd be stoked if someone else wants to own that so they can focus on the exchange process itself. In fact, if you can arb cefi <> defi well, your risk free rate is high enough that you can use what you earn to subsidize trades, which is what they're doing atm.

On the infra specifically, they've been using azure sgx to run a single sequencer and some validators. They need it for price discovery and they really care about latency: cancellation time is what determines how tight your spreads are for mm. Interestingly, they don't really care if an SGX exploit is found that is read only, especially after the fact, because they only care about pretrade privacy and want things happening real quick. Seem to have gotten their benchmarks down from 180ms to 100ms between talking with Xin and me.

Today, mach uses an offchain orchestrator. The next version will use a performance driven lottery, which he'd love to discuss with <@U05BMHJMRNK> as well as get any performance datawe can share around what we're building and how they might get more involved. (The only thing that would really sell them, if they can run a kettle that is quick enough is if using SUAVE gets them more OF because that it what they're all about atm).

Flow Traders - Chris King (US bd, ventures, partnerships)

• US office has a few traders. Core devs are based in Amsterdam. Chris heads up the US side of bd, partnerships, and venture.
• Pretty similar conversation as the EthCC one. Chris will follow-up with <@U03PZSSETQA> regarding builder requirements for market makers. They are making a big push to be more active as contributors in DeFi. I mentioned that we needed help with strategic bidding and if they wanted to share Geth code on the builder features that they needed, we would be able to implement them in Rust.  
• I pushed the option of having them run a relay since they have the dev capacity, resources, validators, and latency set-up. Chris liked the idea and will follow-up.
• On the SUAPP side, he is conversing with Markus and Propellerheads. They are still interested in market making / strategic investments in SUAPPs. <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03G0PNEV0E>

For orderflow, itʻs better if you talk to their devs directly regarding implementation since they have similar requirements as SCP.

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Comms-Sync-ae5506acaf7143f18a78b634df8f1b07?pvs=4|Uniswap Comms Sync Read Out from Last Two Meetings>: CC: <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03G0PNEV0E>
• *CTG & Unichain & TEE Synergy:* CTG is exploring new use cases for Season 3 and the theme is: _Resurrection Island._ Resurrection Island has the unique mechanic that players who are voted out can play in parallel with the other "ghost players" and occasionally the top player will be allowed back into the game. 
    ◦ CTG has said they're generally down to collab on this front and incorporating TEEs enabling novel mechanics
    ◦ Want to deploy season 3 on Unichain, the Uniswap Lab's perspective is that it is unlikely to be ready by EOY (CTG was acquired by Uniswap Labs but still operates fairly separately)
• *Comms Strategy around Unichain:*
    ◦ *Unichain Whitepaper* (sept 9th, potentially pushed back to sept 17th)
        ▪︎ Message: Unichain brings liquidity onchain. The Unichain vision is to be a global liquidity hub and does not view other rollups as competitors. Uniswap is becoming a platform instead of a product with unichain and univ4.
        ▪︎ Vibes: Technical and academic with a smidge of playfulness
        ▪︎ Content: Relevant to us it will feature a section on TEE enforced tx ordering, Flashblocks, and MEV Taxes, opportunity for us to collaborate on these. Ontop of that it will mention the use of Uni tokens as staking for early pre-finality confirmation
        ▪︎ Additionally open to a TEE coprocessing section
        ▪︎ Ideally links to Flashblocks writing from Flashblots
    ◦ *Uniswap Blog Post* (sept 9th, also potentially pushed back to sept 17th)
        ▪︎ Vibe: More lower level and consumer friendly
        ▪︎ Ideally links to Flashblocks writing from Flashblots
    ◦ *Flashbots Blog Post* (sept 9th, potentially pushed back to sept 17th)
        ▪︎ We will collab with Uniswap on a post that outlines the technical architecture of flashblocks, relevant benchmarks, and also opens up and hints at the coming TEE ecosystem narrative and bringing social liquidity onchain in addition to financial liquidity.
        ▪︎ potentially will include demo in this but depends on the time line
        ▪︎ ideally we have an outline by next weds, I will reach out  <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U03G0PNEV0E> 
    ◦ *Following Weeks* there will be a series of spotlights on individual components of the Unichain
        ▪︎ attestation service for TEEs is one that we will help with, other options are also open. 
        ▪︎ this is a great opportunity for us to get awesome visualization and story telling around TEEs CC <@U055KQHH3FZ> <@U03GALFRWRG> <@U06G8D1Q87R> <@U03G97GK4JZ> 
• *Devcon Demo:*
    ◦ Out of scope right now as we're sprinting towards the September anouncements
    ◦ one cool idea though: runescape grand exchange powered by Unichain :zap:️
• *Zora:*
    ◦ They recently launched a uniswap collab so we probed on whether there was opportunity to bring them into the collab
    ◦ they dont know about unichain and are essentially just angling towards a meme token launcher with the aforementioned collab
• *Miscellaneous:*
    ◦ Uniswap is launching a security competition for v4 tomorrow that starts september 2nd
    ◦ they have designers that can help us with diagrams and even an animated gif if we give 2 weeks lead time :wink:

My notes from Azuki meeting yesterday CC: <@U03G0PNEV0E>
• <https://x.com/2pmflow|2pmflow (azuki co-founder)> seems largely like the CTO and decision maker around tech
• 2pmflow seems very excited about TEEs but just started his journey *checks notes * last week
• Bobu work is being led by Liz and didnt have any decision makers on the call
• 2pmflow is interested in building something akin to "anime.id" that users can link their socials to accounts on the chain and accept tips on various platforms
• Azuki was curious on what the shape of our partnership would look like and what type of resources we could commit
    ◦ I told them that we were very interested in closely collaborating with a smaller number of parties and especially found their willingness to experiment and their consumer distribution channel as something very unique.
        ▪︎ They double clicked on what exactly we were looking for, my sense is they're wondering if we're just using them as distribution or whether we actually want to develop a collaborative partnership.
• We agreed to a crawl-walk-run approach where in the short term:
    ◦ crawl: <@U03G0PNEV0E> will collaborate on the Bobu demo and also host brainstorming sessions with 2pm flow
    ◦ walk: after initial explorations we can explore what a closer collaboration looks like and what types of apps they want users to enable and even help develop a couple key suapps
    ◦ run: offer our coprocessing platform on azuki chain to their ecosystem

Hotcoin Global Exchange - Evian Zhang (bd)
<@U06TUB9EW2Y> <@U05DY4WTLUB>

Hotcoin was introʻd to us by one of their investors that I met at SBC.  They have agreed to integrate with Protect and have OriginId: HotCoin.
• Hotcoin has hqʻs in Dubai and N. America.
• They are licensed in over 100+ countries.
• Users are mainly from Asia and the Middle East.
• They use an exchange router + app (no web3 wallet).
• They have different priority fee settings for different operations and keep a withdrawal fee rate higher than the real-time network rates.

Had a chat with Markus from PropellerHeads:
• their 4 month shitcoin indexer turned into a 12month abstracted SDK available for any chain and they’ve decided to OSS it
    ◦ for launch we can write up a design for using it on SUAVE, or more advanced, build out a PoC with it but I said we cant commit resources
    ◦ launch timeline is 4 - 6 weeks
• Said Toliman EIP 712 Signature was huge UX improvement
• Want to launch Turbine (their darkpool) at Devcon but unsure if will have an audit done
    ◦ I recommended they launch with a capped trade amount even without audit
    ◦ we jammed on some potential demo ideas and they mentioned it would be super cool if UniV4 launches so they could build a hook with it (I didn't tell him about Unichain obviously so he didnt realize how cool of synergy this has)
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 17/08/2024 08:57:16 Z:
|   This is a good reminder that we need to build out an audit supply chain for Suapps (not build ourselves, but ensure its getting built). Otherwise will be very hard to launch mainnet apps that people trust.

Especially in the light of Uniswap pushing the planned co-marketing launch by 1 month unilaterally.  (cc <@U02CJ9QVAL9>)

Had a good chat with Barry yesterday. Two relevant items:

1. Skip is leaning into their oracle product for L2s and think they can go head to head with Chainlink for L2 market share (<https://docs.skip.build/connect/introduction|Skip Connect>). They are trying to weigh internally whether it makes sense to lean into TEEs to create a differentiator for the oracle product (over the centralized Chainlink alternatives). But they aren't sure about the time and resource commitment. What he wanted to pick my brain about what the notion of control and its relation to regulatory actions. 
2. Skip has a few routing products that could greatly benefit from TEEs from a regulatory concern but those are more likely Q2 next year, after (if) they've built expertise with TEEs for the Oracle product. 
Skip is trying to find the delta between in-house TEE expertise and utilizing something like a TEE Stack and moderate in-house knowledge to launch TEE products. They want to know how deep do they have to be in-house to build TEE products on a SUAVE TEE stack.

Google Cloud -
• Devan Mitchem (strategy + data partnerships)
• Alberto Martin (head pm of google cloud)
FB mates - <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03G0PNEV0E> <@U06TUB9EW2Y>

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Google-Cloud-August-19-2024-2da6417557624b9f8290afcde139b510|Notes>

tldr;

Introductory meeting with Alberto Martin - head of Google Cloud product and a 20+ year product manager, and Devan Mitchem - strategy + data partnerships. The meeting was for Alberto to gauge FB roadmap and TDX usage and obtain market intel on what is happening in Ethereum.
• Albertoʻs key question: Is FB goal to be the main provider of all block space infra?
    ◦ His thoughts are that if FB becomes the dominant cross-chain MEV infrastructure layer, if they do not provide a TDX solution for us then no validators run in Google Cloud.
    ◦ If FB has the fastest hardware solution, then everyone else will conform to FB standards.
• Albertoʻs key question: Is FB positioning itself to move into advertisements?
    ◦ With Teleport and FB auction mechanisms, FB can sell and delegate ads.
• Tina asks: How can FB get Intel to implement a change to TDX?
    ◦ Alberto has interacted with Intel several times. He convinced Intel to create a cheaper chip for the Chromebook by structuring a deal with Arm first and getting them to build a cheaper competitive chip.

• Forrest is ready to move forward to find a PoC partner and going to get an official commitment date from Andrew and Emiliano 
• They're launching a "high speed sequencer product" mid October but didn't get anymore details
• Ideal co-marketing looks like private notion -> blog post -> OP Forum post, where the last two can happen simultaneously

• his previous work includes 5 years exploiting hardware side channels
• Semiotic AI is a core dev team of <https://thegraph.com/|The Graph>
• their team is focusing on data verifiability within the graph, because data has errors
• they're looking into low latency coprocessors - consuming historical data offchain and giving a means of verification on chain
• first only zk centered approach but now their looking at TEEs as well

Talked to Kubi of Titan yesterday:
• He told me they had thought about launching something decentralized, but were undecided and felt they weren't the right team for that anyway Instead they plan to keep competing.
• They see their path to winning as being more "service oriented" towards orderflow providers, e.g. providing more features and products so they have an orderflow advantage relative to the trading firms.
• They have some building algorithms that are more profitable, but they turned them off because orderflow providers wanted more determinism in how things are ordered and why
• We brainstormed ways they could be a "player" in a decentralized network... and neither of us came up with anything substantive because we don't think "provide private bundle merging code" could work unless you are willing to trust that code doesn't break a bunch of variants we care about (think: OFA rules).
• We talked about their org culture and growth. They are 15 now, almost all engineering.
    ◦ Everyone in Titan talks to customers and knows their requirements, and so there are a bunch of “watercooler” conversations in the office where people share ideas for how to better serve customers as a block builder (”oh X wants this kind of ordering? you can do that by…”)
• They are almost entirely focused on winning L1 still. The team dedicates minimal time to other stuff.
• Kubi didn't really seem to care much for based pre-confs, but they're spending some cycles on it as
    ◦ a hedge
    ◦ a way to invest in the long-term capability of building 2 chains at once
• They have a custom built Rust client that outperforms Reth
    ◦ Kubi thinks there will be alpha in this for awhile still yet, and doesn't expect Reth to catch up
    ◦ Moreover, this provides an edge to them because everyone in the team really understands how a client works and that leads to a lot of small design decisions that make a performance difference

|   "He told me they had thought about launching something decentralized, but were undecided and felt they weren't the right team for that anyway Instead they plan to keep competing."

that would be huge news if true
|   that said, they are still a very powerful L1 competitor in either case, and the fact that they see their path to winning as "better service -&gt; exclusive orderflow" shows why its hard to have them inside a network that itself seeks to arbitrage competition over orderflow
|   It's also not 100% clear that removing competition for orderflow is _good_ when it drives builders to offer better and better service to transactors. that's a big ?? to resolve

|   scp reaction to that "news"
|   hard to say if it's real or not really... when I pressed on the long term plans they have for their centralized builder Kubi said they'd eventually launch an institutional business for the centralized regulated building activity, and they'd participate in a decentralized one too
|   the extremely paranoid reading is they're actively pursuing L2s, pre-confs, and a decentralized network but they don't want us to know that

In another conversation with Kubi, he mentioned exactly the same thing. That's one of their main selling point and it's hard to decentralize, right?
If we can solve this we could either have a competitive advantage or have a higher chance bringing titan on board.
Ofc. they might as well be working on a solution in secret and just checking in whether we have any idea how to solve this yet. Doesn't sound realistic though with a team of 15 with no privacy experience (to my knowledge).

Janine from Edge City (the zuzalu spinoff that did Edge Esmeralda in Healdsberg) asked if we would be interested in (co)organising a MEV event at Edge Lanna (in chiang mai, the month before devcon).

<@U06TUB9EW2Y>

I met up with the Radius team after our KBW panel.

• Radius summary:
    ◦ Radius helps L2s profit from MEV. They created an encrypted “marketplace” (L1 mempool) before the sequencer where “builders” (L1 “searchers”) can bundle transactions into the bottom-of-the-block (“bundle”) and extract MEV. The bundle is then sent to the sequencer for execution. They use a smart contract to verify transactionʻs order in the bundle.
    ◦ They will be launching a 2nd price auction for searchers at Devcon. They are interested in running this auction in a TEE for security and privacy. <@U05BMHJMRNK> 
    ◦ They do not track any L2 MEV that passes through their marketplace.
• Radius implemented a solution like Sorellaʻs on Polygon but shut it down because they were worried about the bundles being sandwiched. In this case, searchers would submit bundles with their orders at ToB while user transactions were BoB, then the next bundle would contain the searcher order ToB.
• Hyun Jeong was interested in learning more about the order flow deals and was worried that exclusive deals between tg bots and builders had a negative effect on the price of ETH.
• <@U03FP0H62HH> Hyun Jeong is a big fan and would like to meet you irl one day.

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Alpha-Wallet-TokenScript-KBW-2024-6f80df032a684632a2d6ea1bb40f19fd|Alpha Wallet / TokenScript> - Victor Zhang (co-founder)
<@U06TUB9EW2Y>

TokenScript summary
• Victor was interested in Teleport and was close to getting a working Teleport version working with a TokenScript token. TokenScript aims to be the SquareSpace for tapps (token apps) with a business model that generates revenue from hosting the files and infrastructure for running tapps.
• TokenScript is generating revenue through consulting contracts with Web2 companies (i.e. Toyota) that are experimenting with TS tokens. They have also developed several games that utilize TS to give users a Tamogochi like experience (feed your pet daily for points and redeem for physical merch or tokens).
TEEs / SUAVE <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U05BMHJMRNK>
• Currently TokenScript does not have any privacy compliance for user data and this could be a potential use case for TEEs.
• <@U03G0PNEV0E> thinks they could use potentially use TEE processing to run the tapps rather than on their centralized server.

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Reclaim-Protocol-KBW-2024-Sept-5-2024-eb1a8c4628fc451ca147462ff83cc728|Reclaim Protocol> - Maddy Malolan
<@U06TUB9EW2Y>

Main issues:
• Compliance requirements are not well defined and storing PII requires an expensive upfront fixed cost for compliance. Reclaim is paying roughly $20/user for under 10k users to be compliant and storing PII. For pilot programs with 1-2k users, it costs roughly $25/ per user. A single customer is a $200k a year cost for Reclaim.
• With scale, Reclaim believes they can push the compliance per user cost down to $.15-.20 / user. They charge for each proof generated and are aiming to decentralize as they scale. For 1 billion users, the cost of decentralization will be $.10 and compliance at $.15-.20.
TEE solution: <@U03G0PNEV0E> <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03GRQX5HGR>
• Maddy believes that they can save on compliance costs since they technically do not need to store PII information if they can validate data provenance within a TEE by generating an encrypted hash of the data. Once the hash is created, the PII data can be deleted and they can use the TEE hash nullified for their proofs.
• Because no PII data is stored by either FB or Reclaim, there should be no legal supervision.
Competitors:
• Their competitors are high value data providers like Plaid (financial data) and Sheer ID (identity). Sheer ID does the verification of student profiles for Spotify and it costs Sheer ID roughly $15 / user with thin profit margins. Reclaim has already started gaining market share on Sheer ID.
Fundraising: <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U02CJ9QVAL9>
• Reclaim is fundraising as some of their early-stage investors from India want liquidity before the token launch. They are not crypto people and prefer the fiat exit. Exit would be via a secondary sale to a syndicate.

I received today this message on Telegram from Zheng Leong Chua (Automata team) and asked me this question (see screenshot).
What do we think about this option? are we interested to be listed as one of their launch partners?

My opinion would be: yes, because we are planning to collaborate with them and use their dcap attestation and on-cahin pccs stuff. I recall <@U055KQHH3FZ> is organizing a Flashwares session with them to discuss more about that, right?

I had an interesting call with Ankr who reached out after seeing the Toliman announcement to ask if they could run nodes.
• They're a small player and likely low on our prio list so I took it as an opportunity to give them a more experimental pitch <@U03GRQX5HGR> and I came up with at a hot pot which is : co-processor and L2 builders are to AVS what the L1 builder node is to the ethereum validator.
• They're interested in running an L1 builder node, I told them likely 2+ quarters away until they could run one so we dont need to follow up immediately since I know we have many more high prio operators <@U03PZSSETQA> 
    ◦ they also only run 500 L1 validators AFAICT, but they do operate on bare metal in some fancy data centers they were proud of
• Surprisingly, they also launched a RaaS product! 
    ◦ they have like 1 or 2 rollups launching this year so they will be low on the prio list but it's nice have a lower prio customer in the mix as the first people we roll out upgrades too in case things go poorly when our staging and automated tests dont catch

|   It’s a massive pain to restart the entire node every time you make a change cuz it has to sync over p2p etc. but I think we likely should support both so u can iterate fast out of process then deploy to prod in process. Also the reth team is going to switch to doing the last few blocks completely in memory anyways so we will have to do in memory

Had a convo with Tools For Humanity, main core dev shop for World Coin:
• They want to build Priority Transactions for Verified for humans and eventually Discounted/gasless txns
• This involves: New Transaction Type/Envelpe
    ◦ includes zk proof (”this tx is from a verified id”), given to block builder, BB verifies, then includes
    ◦ some “reserve” space for non-priority gas fees
• They were building a parallel Builder API and came across our work
• Had some questions about implementation and additionally how changing the ordering policy is a grey area for the superchain
• They want to help us accelerate getting this work adopted by OP so we will move towards more communication in the OP R&D discord! (Read: we just got some new core devs!)
• They're building their own custom payload builder on reth
    ◦ took a look at rbuilder but didnt like that it was out-of-process
    ◦ <@U02CJ9QVAL9> swayed them to take a second look

<@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U03G0PNEV0E> <@U06TUB9EW2Y>

• SAFE is exploring under-collateralized loans as a new research initiative, taking a more account-centric user view. Their north star has shifted from TVL to total volume processed. They are still in the very preliminary stage of under-collateralized loans and TEE research.
• SAFE preference is towards collaboration.
    ◦ Financial institutions have spoken to SAFE about entering DeFi. They are looking for ways to express risk preferences with DeFi - i.e. the user is ok with ZK networks but not Optimistic networks.
    ◦ AAVE is working on a prototype where you can interact with AAVE and lend out assets without the assets leaving the SAFE account. This is done with a micro-rollup resource lock.
    ◦ Gnosis Pay blocks a userʻs account for 3 minutes (resource lock) so that the txn can settle on the Visa network.
• SAFE is also researching private mempools and a signature connection service. The last signer of an MPC wallet publishes the transaction on-chain. They need a trusted environment to run this signature connection service which would allow them to scale their network support.
• SAFE has 10mm users total storing over 60 billion crypto assets. They have 90 people on their team with roughly 25 working on product related projects.
• They are currently focused on monetization of the IP rights of their trademarks. SAFE recently integrated CoWswap into their swap infrastructure and usersʻ have started using it because they trust the SAFE brand.
• Christoph wants to learn more about web2 use cases for tees and is interested in seeing how it can help SAFE identify userʻs risk appetite and transform them into intents. SAFEʻs core competency is account level user expression of risk appetite. Developing user applications is not a strength for the team. They would prefer to collaborate than compete.
• SAFEʻs GTM is driven by Ethereum events and they will be releasing a few pocs at Devnet.

Came across <https://cubist.dev/|this> project that provides a kind of intelligent TEE <https://cubist.dev/blog/cubist-launches-millisecond-latency-wallet-as-a-service-platform|key manager> ("remote signer"/"wallet-as-a-service")
• They use Nitro to put a wrapper of extra logic around the HSMs available in the cloud
• Are featured on aws website for their validator product which prevents slashing from equivocation (similar to puffer I believe)
Relevance to us is that they use TEEs and also their validator product is an interesting encumbrance/policy engine use case (of which we were already aware)

> Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 12/09/2024 16:05:12 Z:
I had a call today with Jean-Francois Rochet, the business unit manager of ledger live. We covered similar topics to my earlier call with Guillaume (CPO). The call reinforced that they are moving quickly towards an MEV solution and we should stay on top of this to ensure we’re part of that process. It was also just a good convo and reinforced for me that they’d be a great partner — smart, professional, ambitious, value-aligned. Would be really nice to land this one. <https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Ledger-Live-follow-up-call-e7cceac770d34374bb98cd7610c1abdc>

Summary:
• The overall goal for ledger live is to “be the preferred place for people to do their transactions”. They’re working on better swap experiences and price comparison across domains, some restaking and yield services, better seed phrase recovery, and a card program where you can use crypto as collateral that’s been hard to get off the ground in the US.
• His main question for Protect was around economics. He wanted to understand how we monetize and what value we can provide to users. He reiterated they care about redundancy and would probably want to have a backup RPC but we didn’t dig into that as much as the $$ stuff.
• I explained how our current refund products work and our philosophy around creating a decentralized and sustainable block builder which will generate more value for customers in the limit and avoid issues that other PFOF providers have (eg not incentive aligned for builders, takes rent in a way that may not be transparent to the customer/OF provider). He grokked this and while it’s always hard to tell he _seemed_ to like the approach.
• The main next step would be to outline a deal for how we work together. I confirmed that we are not a DAO and they would be engaging with a regular corporate entity. Jean-Francois seemed flexible to not having a strict SLA/legal agreement and noted that they do want to move quickly. (It sounds like they’ve already begun their trials with other providers FYI, they are moving fast here.) Their main concern is having confirmation that we will “do no harm” to customers, won’t “cause money to disappear”, and maintain a certain level of quality. I mentioned that we’re working to provide those integrity guarantees with TEEs in the long run and plan to send over some material on how we ensure good service to customers in the short term. We should be ready for them to ask for a more official agreement though, which is worth flagging since we haven’t done that in the past.
• Another next step is for their engineering team to do due diligence and have a chat with us about specific technical integration steps and requirements next.
• FYI <@U03GRQX5HGR> <@U06TUB9EW2Y> Jean-Francois will be at token 2049 from tuesday to friday and asked if I was going. I mentioned that you two will be there if you want to connect.

Connected with Jesse briefly at a Base event:
• they want to do “something” about mev in 2025
• people on their team don’t necessarily agree, but that’s what he thinks
• he thought that they had to do something about the spam problem
• he asked about running the software himself and paying some take rate to us, because they want to be neutral
• I pointed out the TEE would also give them the ability to verify neutrality of their sequencer, he loved that
• I also pointed out it would come with free TEE proofs for helping them get to stage 2, he also really liked that
• he pointed me to Roberto, who is working on scaling - and some guys named Wilson and Sam who would be the “business counterparts” as people to talk to
then I talked to Roberto:
• he didn’t seem to care at all about spam - we went back and forth and he literally shrugged his shoulder at it repeatedly. To him the real problem is how do you get people to use this stuff, not how to scale it.
• he didn’t think spam was much of a problem today or that it would be in the future - he was fine with it if 25% of their block was mev spam
• we talked about a bunch of other stuff - they’re working on fast block times and pushing the sequencer more. They want to hit 200m gas per second end of 2025
• they are most worried about state growth, but he described all of these scaling problems as engineering issues that will be solved with engineering even if they were hard
• our state root and parallel builder work piqued his interest, he asked if it was open source 
so a mix of good reception from Jesse and bad from Roberto - still I’m bullish given Jesse’s reception!

|   I agree that spam from searchers is honestly not super compelling from an engineering POV. Additionally, I think it’s not clean that revert protection gives u less feedback. But nonetheless I think it’s a good narrative we should stick with. 

These people seem pretty satisfied on tinkering with gas per second on their builder. Unless we get them something meatier, I doubt they will like us taking their toy away.

|   I think I saw a chart from <@U05578MHMUZ> earlier, and only around 5% of base gas is lost to reverts.
that's a good proxy for spam, right? Since most spam txns are designed to revert?
|   
|   > danning [U05578MHMUZ] @ 13/09/2024 14:02:59 Z:
|   It’s funny they don’t see the spam issue 

because 

they have been scaling up their gas target so many times this year, from 1Mgas/s to 10M gas/s now - ofc you don’t see gas congestion and high gas price if u just keep making ur block size bigger when it gets congested & and instead have to worry about state growth. 

The revert rate for base was as high as 20% when it just switched to dencun with a gas drop. It now dropped to 5% range because I feel there’s less meme activity and hence less spamming. But it doesn’t mean their system is resistant to the problem

|   If large amount of gas is used and paid for by the searchers to the sequencer for these reverted txs, while there’s still a lot of throughput / block space, can we say it’s “wasted”? 
To me it seems like a good deal for Base, they get paid and the volume / txs looks high, showing the chain is actively being used, and there’s still tons of block space capacity so gas fees didn’t spike and user txs didn’t get delayed like ethereum.

|   > Elaine [U03N9H4JP8C] @ 13/09/2024 18:12:58 Z:
|   sure sure, but we’re trying to convince Base this is bad for them right? so from what I heard Jesse said during a podcast they aim to keep tx cost to < 1 cent/tx and uses this as a benchmark to adjust their throughput, so their users don’t end up paying high gas fees.
So their goal is to maintain active usage on the chain across all time. To me they are not yet concerned about spamming yet because they know they’re not ethereum, they need to acquire users first (whatever kinda of user it is) That’s why they have user gas sponsoring at dapp level, using smart wallet to fund the user account so they can use the dapps (like the social and gaming ones) without having to fund them first

well - someone is going to capture the arb _either way_ and will be willing to pay for it, the question is what the negative effect of capturing that arb it. Base could still capture have the actual productive arb activity (e.g. the ones that don't revert) while getting paid and having more gas for other users of the chain.
|   my wife tells me jesse loves to just hype people up and say yes to things though
|   
|   > Elaine [U03N9H4JP8C] @ 13/09/2024 19:51:37 Z:
|   their intuition of geniun user being jeopardised by spamming seems to be based on when tx cost goes above $0.01/tx. Unless we can find such cases, it’d be hard to argue it’s bad for their users. Luke Youngblood from Moonwell also said Base use the sequencer revenue to sponsor gas txs for users, so they’re literally taking the hit when gas spikes!

It leads to state bloat but no one is working on that anyways and those ore coins are way worse.

Franci organizing an event in Shanghai:

Hi Tomasz! It’s Franci from Panta Rhei. We met at Shenzhen Researcher House! So glad that you noticed this event in Starknet MEV tg group :wink: Yep! We're planing a MEV-themed event in Shanghai this October. <https://github.com/0xpantarhei/MEV-Shanghai|https://github.com/0xpantarhei/MEV-Shanghai>

MEV Shanghai is a MEV-focused event that combines a 7-day Research House with 2 days of side events during the Shanghai International Blockchain Week. <https://x.com/WXblockchain/status/1802607014595674207|https://x.com/WXblockchain/status/1802607014595674207>

At MEV Shanghai, we are focusing on the centralization concerns under Ethereum PoS design and how to mitigate them. That is to explore some open problems around these topics and discuss potential solutions to toxic MEV and centralized staking.

We have two days event with MEV Supply Chain DAY on Oct 15th and MEV Re-distribution DAY on Oct 16th. We’d love to invite you as an event speaker. Would you be interested in giving a talk related to the MEV Supply Chain?

Quick notes on Azuki: <@U03G0PNEV0E> <@U055KQHH3FZ> 
• Attended Azuki x Arbitrum event in Singapore
• Azuki founder Zagabond (former 0x founding team) is super excited for our collab on TEE co-processor (Azuki cto 2pm filled him in) on our upcoming livestream stunta collab, open to explore more down the road (my understanding is stuff like their roll-up and micro payment stuff)
• Met the KP of our partnership on Azuki team Whizwang, also super excited.
• Met OKX growth team NFT marketplace PM & marketing, they have one of the highest volume in the NFT space (not super high on evm chains tho). They were really impressed by Azuki Collab with us, offered to help co-market Azuki TEE co-processor case, and potentially package this as a service to all of their NFT projects as potential value add service

Quick note on OKX wallet growth team (at Azuki meetup)
• OKX wallet has 400 people on their team:joy: 
• integrated over 100 chains and run their own nodes for all of them, built their own bridge infra, their own l2, their own dex... all part of this big team
• their latest growth strategy was NFT marketplace (hence they prioritize collab with azuki, penguin, etc)
• we have 3 tg groups with OKX (2 investment related, 1 for ordeflow adoption with exchange wallet) - the key person in our exchange wallet tg chat just left OKX, but they can help us find the right contact there and follow through
• their growth team are down to explore collab on:
    ◦ mev-prevention: they have this as an option already for users to opt in on web3 wallet UI - I'm not sure if they are already Collab with us or not
    ◦ tee-coprocessor marketing gadget for NFT projects
    ◦ they have a sybil problem wonder if we can help technically but need their technical team for details

|   
|   > George Zhang [U05DY4WTLUB] @ 17/09/2024 22:59:50 Z:
|   Regarding MEV protection, they are the first one I onboarded. Yes they are already using Protect. I had to pressure them not to switch to BlockNative as default, which managed to get Transaction Boost adopted in exchange for OKX wallet ranking higher on their Web3-onboard wallet connector.
|   <@U03PZSSETQA> I tried to do it but my PoC told me it is very hard to push such conversation on exchange wallet side right now because the priority fee is too low for them to prioritize it.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 17/09/2024 23:16:45 Z:
|   <@U05DY4WTLUB> I think okex is very relationship driven, the new wallet growth marketing girl apparently really likes me as another girl in crypto (?:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:) and committed to nag their product team to prioritize this for us... <@U03PZSSETQA>
|   I think in this case we can follow up quickly with OKX after this week when they travel back to Beijing.

forgot to update: blocknative transaction-boost deal
• met up with Matt Cutler during paradigm frontier in sf
• he would be down to give us the transaction boost code and of for like a 100k grant or something, mostly good will and symbolic, he prefers in the form of us buying their new flagship product mempool service hence boosting their revenue, he seems to have a year end revenue and key partnership crunch time
• he really really wants to collab with us long term, this as a starting point 
• he's super interested in the private mempool gas API if tee builders can provide such signals for gas estimator

|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 18/09/2024 00:01:49 Z:
|   I don’t want their code for any amount of money. I could be convinced to buy their orderflow but for a fraction of that price.
|   By code I specifically mean their transaction boost code
|   Did you suggest that he could get paid for the orderflow in another way like a potential incentivized orderflow program we run for our decentralized builder?
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 18/09/2024 00:03:14 Z:
|   I think both were meant as a package, and I suspect 50-100k would be the range.

It wasn’t that valuable in conclusion. I think like $1k a day in prio fees.
|   
|   > Hasu [U03FP0H62HH] @ 18/09/2024 07:44:03 Z:
|   $1k a day in prio fees (if they are truly exclusive) is nothing to scoff at though. I'd pay $50k for that
|   
|   > Shea Ketsdever [U03PZSSETQA] @ 18/09/2024 15:33:40 Z:
|   > If they are truly exclusive
I asked matt what kinds of guarantees we could get about orderflow exclusivity. He said there would be “no explicit terms of commitments from existing sources of order flow moving forward”, meaning that even if there are exclusive tx boost users today they would be under no obligation to remain exclusive tomorrow.

Also, tx boost was explicitly designed as a product to multiplex between OFAs / RPCs. (Matt: “the core concept (and technology) of Transaction Boost is a private venue multiplexing service”). If we were to change this and make the flow exclusive we would essentially be deleting the main value prop that customers are using the product for. Seems likely that retention could suffer or they would look for someone else who fulfills this need.

Tl;dr even if a subset of the flow is exclusive to tx boost today, there are no guarantees it will remain that way, and removing the RPC multiplexing feature would likely cause churn.

quick update on worldcoin (world chain) x mev <@U02CJ9QVAL9> <@U05BMHJMRNK> <@U03PZSSETQA> <@U03FP0H62HH> 
• spoke to remco (head of protocol, cryptography researcher) today
• they are using h100s GPU tees with their smpc, working with automata <https://x.com/AutomataNetwork/status/1836407604517773374?s=19|https://x.com/AutomataNetwork/status/1836407604517773374?s=19>
• World Coin apparently got locked into multi-year AWS contract, which Automata also found to be rather unfortunate given the trust implications...
• *Remco proactively mentioned that they would like to discuss with Flashbots on the topic of MEV mitigation + prioritize human transactions in Ethereum blockspace, as they will start to explore putting user transactions on chain (so far been off chain as they didn't wanna deal with hairy issues like mev while solving more urgent user data privacy issue.* 
• *I* softly flexed Flashblocks key selling points, Remco seemed impressed by promising UX and performance, the potential of "base sequencing" benefit of tee l1 & l2 synergy.
• he's really into figuring out inventive compatible design able to prioritize human transactions
• Next Steps:
    ◦ He doesnt respond in telegram, suggested coordinate through DCBuilder to set up signal group in the future
    ◦ they would like to workshop this with us at Devcon. 
    ◦ World Chain is still in private beta on OP mainnet as migrating 12 million real world users to a new chain takes time.
    ◦ This can be a high priority partnership (though maybe controversial :joy:), but imo likely 1h2025 would be co-design phase only.

|   > dmarz [U05BMHJMRNK] @ 19/09/2024 18:13:36 Z:
|   We've started collaborating with tools for humanity on OP Stack block builder design and their human priority transaction approach. I am a bit unsure of how to approach their org though. Is Remco also at Tools For Humanity or the World Coin Foundation? Im trying to figure out if us offering to build their block builder takes away work from Tools For Humanity or frees them up to do other stuff.
|   
|   > Tina [U03GRQX5HGR] @ 19/09/2024 18:16:18 Z:
|   I've no idea their org structure, the only thing I know is he's the one who makes all important *technical* *decisions* (protocol, privacy, but not orbs) for worldcoin...
|   forgot to note, he specifically said h
they will start with whatever interop standards opstack default to as they had not invested research into this area

I think mark tyneway will know more too

quick note on Google partnership:
• meeting with ultimate boss at GCP web3 cloud & digital asset was very successful thanks to all the help at our <#C05BNG83MV4|> <#C061GEM5815|> channel :pray: 
• Google mike asked if he can help steer resources to accelerate, they will look into it
• If performance optimization takes time, if opening up has significant security trade offs in the near term, he suggested we can co-author a blogpost on Google's technical blog on how to do confidential compute right, and Google can publicly commit to a roadmap on what should be done. They are also open to contribute to any of our position papers <@U03HT20PJES> <@U03FP0H62HH> <@U055KQHH3FZ> <@U04QCPQ0CG5> 
• got introduced to head of APAC BD from Google ads team covering key accounts in advertising dollars (McDonald's, Ford, etc) and they are web3 friendly and open to experiment. Singapore and Thailand are innovation testing ground for Google ads. 
    ◦ gcp Devon thinks this guy may help convince YouTube merit of encumbered account as a growth hack (with brands)
• With Google on the co-marketing front I expect we can:
    ◦ co-author blogpost & papers
    ◦ Google Next cloud developer conf partner 
    ◦ dedicated section on GCP web3 solution page

|   Banana Gun notes: Daniel

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Banana-Gun-04f9eca4ffa04b1fafdcad8545c980ae>

<@U02CJ9QVAL9> details of their exploit in the note.

1. Updated BG on priority gas refunds and BoB progress.
    ◦ Daniel concerned about inclusion rate. Beaver was given OF but they didnʻt focus on BGʻs inclusion rate and it dropped to < 80%. BG is looking for a 96% inclusion rate. Their sniping orders are ultra important and their current market edge. Lower inclusion will drive snipers to other platforms.
    ◦ BG wants to drop Beaver because they started backrunning BG txns without BG consent. But they can only drop Beaver if that doesnʻt hurt their inclusion rate. Current plan is to drop Beaver after they launch their webapp.
    ◦ Daniel was interested in BoBand appending orders to EoB (limit orders, swaps). It might take some dev work on their end but this is something they are interested in. <@U03G59ZN90D> 
2. For security, talked about possibly using TEEs for session key safety.
    ◦ BG tried using Turnkey for this but there was too much latency (30-40ms). BG requires < 1ms latency. BG hasnʻt optimized any of their code for latency.
3. Briefly touched on sending FB the txns that get sent to the public mempool for min-bid validator blocks.
    ◦ Daniel hasnʻt looked that much at this but should be able to send these txns to FB.
    ◦ ** If FB matches min-bid via a subsidy will this drive the min-bid rates higher? <@U03HT20PJES> <@U057K31N2J3> <@U07HEP26B36> 
4. Order flow update. <@U03PZSSETQA> 
    ◦ Daniel is good with making FB a back-up builder for their sniping orders. They need to maintain a 96%+ inclusion rate for their sniping orders so this might come later once we have a majority of blocks coming through.
    ◦ He is fine sending limit orders and swap orders to FB builder if we multiplex to his preferred builder list (not-Beaver).
5. BG update.
    ◦ Currently focussed on autopsy of their exploit. Notes are below but it looks a TG issue with session keys. FB has a chance to collaborate here using TEEs as additional security. BG looking at how to prevent session keys compromises from a security aspect.
    ◦ Webapp and API are the next features to be delivered. Looking to roll-out the webapp by devcon.

|   
|   > Quintus [U03HT20PJES] @ 22/09/2024 14:28:33 Z:
|   There is no built in mechanism by which min bid would automatically rise. Its a social question: perhaps some teams target a certain % of blocks built locally in which case it may shift but I suspect many people have set and forget it
|   
|   > Data Always - Edward [U07HEP26B36] @ 22/09/2024 15:16:37 Z:
|   The Lido DAO has a limit on the max value Lido node operators can set for min-bid. It’s at 0.07 ETH and I don’t think (?) it’s ever changed. All lido operators that currently use it use the max value and of entities we could tag to modify our bids like 90% will be just those operators.

Automata notes:  Deli Gong, Zheng Leong Chua, Oana

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Automata-160cb1d513f2465296257f9617cd65de>

Background:
• They are focused on developing tools and SDK for developers. Initially they aimed to solve MEV and build applications in 2021, but pivoted to focus on TEE platforms. Their first product was an RPC with privacy protection. They developed a TEE block builder which Justin Drake saw and that led to a collaboration with Scroll to build multiprovers. Now they are focused on attestations and helping teams with TEE attestation implementations.
Edge:
• Providing attestations with a focus on smart contract identity and proof of identity.
Target customers:
• Applications: 1) abstracted wallets, 2) anti-sybil solutions for gaming, and 3) KYC/KYB regulatory attestation.
Current customers:
• ZK Sync: Consulted with ZK Sync but ZK Sync then hired an in-house TEE team.
• Scroll: Co-developed multiprover for Scroll and runs it for them.
• Worldcoin: Developing attestation solutions for Worldcoin that WC will run.
• Taiko: Providing attestations.
• Linea: Multiprover services.
AVS - TEE Service:
• Exploring if they can host a TEE layer on Eigenlayer. They are currently running an AVS there for multiproving. The AVS previously ran validators for Secret and Phala. There is minimal state management for operators.
Roadmap:
1. Scale Eigenlayer AVS to provide TEE service (multiprovers)
2. Develop operators for attestation layer, similar to RiskZero. Everyone can generate a proof and this proof can be verified on chain.
Business Model:
• Attestation fees embedded in L2 gas fees (licensing model)
• Hosting and servicing model fees. They take token grants for projects without tokens.
• Potential new model: TDX block builder running on AVS infrastructure
FB Collaboration Opportunities:
• TEE solution for multiprover side (2-3 months timeline)
• Research and feasibility studies for new ground
• TDX builder for 2025 network. Automata has no capacity issues and want to do more application proof of concepts.
• TEE proof on OP stack.
    ◦ Oana previously proposed a TEE prover to the OP team but they never heard back.
    ◦ Co-design prover boost for OP stack paired with L2 block builder. FB doesnʻt need to own the prover which can leverage Automataʻs core edge.
    ◦ Challenges with BASE due to AWS background and preference for Nitro

GSR notes:  Alain Kunz, Jacob, Andrew

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/9944eb75830a4a0dbf08cbdd41d0ef7f?v=1096b4a0d8768043908d000c1f942073&p=1076b4a0d87680ce911dc2eb2e0c45eb&pm=s>

Overview
• They recently restructured their trading teams to have a centralized risk management view. They aim to internalize as much risk as possible and are capable with absorbing the majority of flow that they see with no impact.
• They have a MAS (Singapore) license and are looking at obtaining a UK license. Their trading desk is in London.
• The company is 200 people.
DeFi:
• Their DeFi team is a work in progress and they are rewriting their strategies in Rust. Their primary focus is sourcing and providing liquidity on DeFi platforms. They do not have their own solver and use 3rd party solvers.
• They are working on upskilling their DeFi team with more improved gas knowledge. They want to become the top player in DeFi (currently lower tier) and sees the fragmentation an edge for them.
Market Focus:
• EVM is still their biggest focus but they are also focusing on Solana and smaller markets with less competition.
Block Building
• They have a partnership with Titan which came about since Alain is Swedish and one of Titanʻs core members is Swedish.  (<@U03TD87PTMK> needs to join their Swedish mafia). 
• Their main priority is winning ToB orders.  
• They are interested in the wallet market share that they can capture and not really focused on block building.

Phala notes: Marvin Tong, Hang

<https://www.notion.so/flashbots/Phala-1086b4a0d87680bbac41e2b82bb533a4>

1. Overview
    a. They want to set up a TEE cloud to make facilitate easier access for others. They want to build the Kubernetes for TEEs so developers can avoid cloud vendor lock. Phala aims to attach worker attestations with the server to allow for migration flexibility.
    b. They are happy to contribute to open source projects but need more clarity into the coordination of SDK development and a long-term roadmap to participate in building.
    c. They are aligned with Dstack and really liked <@U06G8D1Q87R> last blog post on the builder.
2. Current Priorities
    a. TEE metering
        i. How to split resources when multiple apps are deployed in the same TEE. They use a VM for gas metering instead of a timer.
    b. TEE benchmarking
3. Challenges
4. PHALA token:
    a. Phalaʻs token could pose an issue. Hang believes that they can offer the TDX cloud as a company service so that itʻs not associated with their Phala Network. The TDX cloud can have its own brand.
5. Contribution:
    a. Phala could be brought on as a core contributor, similar to Nethermind. It would be like the EF and Consensys relationship for shared researchers.
6. Communication:
    a. Phala will link papers, repos, and blog posts to their <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z5zwyrEPhmhThpIn03p1hdtQeYx2k7i81-zqwFwwqPo/preview#heading=h.33fp5kts2mfm|collaboration paper>. 
Action Items:
• <@U03GRQX5HGR> will assign to FB teams to review and split tasks.
